The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate in the November 16 election, Douye Diri has urged the Independence National Electoral Commission, INEC, to provide a level playing field for all the candidates, while maintaining its position as unbiased umpire
Diri , a serving Senator had recently emerged as the party’s flag bearer for the November 16 governorship election, after the keenly contested PDP primary in Bayelsa state. Diri emerged the PDP candidate after the election contested by a total of 21 aspirants , with a total of 561 votes to defeat his close kinsman and former Presidential Adviser on Niger Delta Affairs, Timi Alaibe, who came second with 365 votes.
Speaking with a select team of Journalists in Abuja on Thursday, Diri said the PDP stands a good chance of retaining power in Bayelsa, adding that “ if elections are free and fair, the All Progressive Congress APC, will not win even a Councilorship election in Bayelsa” He noted that the only threat to PDP chances was the fear of use of federal might, adding that” INEC must play its role as an unbiased umpire. What we are hearing is the fear of the use of federal might to intimidate and threaten voters, the threats to rewrite results and use of security to intimidate the opposition party” The PDP candidate also appealed to Security agencies, against allowing itself to be used to intimidate voters. Diri, while speaking on the allegation that he was favored because he will be used as “ stooge” in the state, disclosed that he is the most qualified for the job, having served the state in various capacities, including working with Niger Delta Development Commission as a close alley with Timi Alaibe for about 10 years and later, as Commissioner for Youths and Sports, when former President Goodluck Jonathan was Governor of Bayelsa state. “ I also served as member of the Governing Council of the University of Maiduguri and later worked as Chief of Staff to Governor Seriake Dickson before proceeding to become a member of House of Representatives for four years. “I served as a member of the finance committee in the state and l know that Governor Dickson never diverted the state’s allocation for personal use while l served in that committee. So, there is nothing to protect” His wealth of experience also include serving as a Senator under the current dispensation, before he was called to take up the higher responsibilities as the Governor of Bayelsa state. Diri disclosed that education will be top on his priority list, as this will enable him build on the achievements of his predecessor.  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
