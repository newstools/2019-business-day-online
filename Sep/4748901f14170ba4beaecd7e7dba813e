The Election Petition Tribunal sitting in Lagos State on Monday dismissed the petitions filed by the Labour Party and reaffirmed the victory of Sanwo-Olu candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) as the duly-elected Governor in the March polls.  The Tribunal described the Labour Party (LP) petition as futile and a wasteful exercise, noting that the petitioners could not prove their allegations of mental incompetence against Sanwo-Olu.  Justice T.T Asua, while delivering the judgement, said the petitioners LP and it candidate, Ifagbemi Awamaridi, also failed to prove the allegations of electoral malpractices against Sanwo-Olu and his party, the APC.
