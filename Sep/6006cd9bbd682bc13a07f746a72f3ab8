The lawmaker representing Egor/ikpoba Okha federal constituency in the National Assembly, Jude Ise-idehen has dedicated his victory at the election petition tribunal to the people of the constituency. Idehen spoke to newsmen after Justice L.O. Ogundana-led three-man tribunal affirmed his election as the winner of the February 23, 2019 national legislative election. The lawmaker’s victory was challenged at the tribunal by Ehiozuwa Johnson Agbonanyima of the All Progressives Congress (APC). While dedicating the victory to the people of the constituency, he assured that the victory would spur him to do more for the people who stood by him during the election and the trial at the tribunal. He noted that there was never a time he nursed the fear that he was going to lose the case at the tribunal because he was the man of the people and that the people voted for him massively. He also commended the tribunal for ensuring that justice prevailed in the petition. The federal lawmaker also assured the constituency of quality representation. The APC candidate had approached the tribunal challenging the declaration of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate by the Independent National Election as winner of the election. He prayed the tribunal to declare the elections of IseIdehen as invalid for noncompliance with the electoral Act 2010 as amended, corrupt practices, not duly elected by majority of lawful votes among others.
