Members of staff at Infinix Nigeria witnessed a brightly colored ambience as Infinix Mobility, Africa’s premium smartphone brand hosted afropop superstar Davido on September 4, 2019 at their Lagos office. The visit was centered on discussions about how the partnership can further empower more Nigerians – Davido being a highly influential personality in the music industry and Infinix mobility being a trend-setting smartphone brand, maintaining an undisputable profile for empowering its youthful and tech-savvy target audience. The cohesive partnership has since inception, served to inspire and empower young adults within their scope of influence, both locally and globally. A typical example of an initiative from both entities geared towards empowering youths and supporting creativity among young adults is the recently concluded #Infinixblowmymindchallenge that rewarded winners with a cash prize of N500,000 and other amazing branded gifts. It would be recalled that Infinix mobility unveiled Davido as its brand ambassador on May 8, 2018, an event, which was a remarkable feat for both parties as Davido signed the contract. As well, customers of the brands and fans of Davido were excited about the new partnership and convinced of the greatness that the power-combination would birth. The Afro-pop star and brand ambassador after the visit took time to take pictures and converse with members of staff before leaving the premises. Asides from the courtesy visit being pleasant, it is also perceived to hold great promises as conversations struck between the brand and its ambassador, and as a result, series of great events are most likely to unfold in the nearest future.
