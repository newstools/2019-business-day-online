The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC), has announced that a total of 2,277,311 improperly-registered lines have been blocked. It said the action followed an earlier directive by the minister of communication, Isa Pantami, that effective last Wednesday, no unregistered/improperly registered SIM card must remain active. The disclosure was made in a statement on Saturday by the Head of Information and public relations unit, ministry of communication, Philomena Oshodin. “In line with the directives of the Honourable Minister of Communications, Dr Isa Ali Ibrahim Pantami, the Nigeria Communications Commission (NCC) has ensured that all improperly registered mobile SIM cards have been blocked. “This is as a result of Dr Pantami’s directives that no improperly registered SIM card should remain active beyond 11:59pm of Wednesday, 25th of September, 2019. “Subsequently, according to the report submitted by the Executive Vice Chairman of NCC on Thursday, 26th September, a total of 2,277,311 improperly registered lines have been blocked”, Oshodin said. According to her, 6,830,249 lines had been revalidated since the directive was given, even as she said all improperly registered SIM cards will remain blocked until they were properly registered. This was even as the Federal Ministry of Communications said that it was collaborating with the relevant parastatals and security agencies, to guarantee the security of lives and property in the country. The Ministry vowed to frustrate attempts by criminal elements to exploit SIM card numbers, to commit crimes. Meanwhile, the minister has applauded the Regulator and Telecom Operators for working hard to carry out the directive in record time, even as he urged them to redouble their efforts at ensuring that the momentum was sustained.
