The second edition of the highly-rated, city-centre conference for the urbane man, Recall for Men Conference, will take place on 21 September, 2019. Themed ‘Maximizing Your Hustle’, this year’s conference holds at Landmark Events Centre, Lagos. The conference comes on the back of a need to address the plethora of challenges and the difficulties facing the 21st-century man in the authentic, truthful and realistic way that will enable him find expression and satisfaction in his passion. Yetunde Bankole-Bernard, chief coaching officer at The Yetunde Bernard Company and convener of Recall for Men, said the theme was selected to help guide participants on navigating social and psychological intricacies in order to achieve all-round fulfilment. The goal is to equip the 21st-century man with valuable and relevant knowledge that helps him adapt and thrive in a dynamic business environment and socio-culturally peculiar society, she said. The event, she said, has two key components, which are the conference and the master-classes. “For the conference, we will focus on lifestyle and relationships, which will be dissected by a panel of discussants. This includes Richard Mofe Damijo, Bizzle Osikoya and Jorge Maciel through audience-participatory mode,” she said. “The master-classes, which are designed to connect, interact and set measurable goals in wealth creation, will be facilitated by seasoned experts who have earned their stripes and distinguished themselves through integrity of purpose in the market place,” she further said. Bankole-Bernard also noted that Africanfarmer Mogaji, Eyo Bassey, Olisa Adibua and Eze Ezegozie will open the vistas into the world of agriculture, fintech/e-commerce, media & entertainment and Music Gone Global.
