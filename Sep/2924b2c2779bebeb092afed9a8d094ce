Agribusiness Insight surfed through three digital agriculture platforms in Nigeria; Thrive Agric, Agrorite, and Farmcrowdy, for any open investment opportunities at the time of going to press. Please note that this is not a recommendation to invest, rather, for information purpose and individuals should carry out independent due diligence. All that is reproduced below has been extracted from information gleaned from each platform. Thrive Agric –         Maize farm in Kaduna Units left (at publication): 15,667 Cost per unit: N62,000 Returns: 20 per cent after 9 Months Insured by Leadway Assurance –         Soybean farms in Kebbi and Niger Units left (at publication): 2,508 Cost per unit: N47,600 Returns: 20 per cent after 9 Months Insured by Leadway Assurance Farmcrowdy did not have open farm cycles at the time of publication but it indicated four investment cycles to be opened soon; Yam Trading and Poultry Farm investments, both scheduled for September, as well as Moringa and a Ginger cycle scheduled for October. Last month, the Ginger cycle was scheduled for November, and the company may have brought the execution date forward by one month. Agrorite also had no available sponsorship opportunity at the time of publication, but indicated a Cassava farm will be open for investment on September 20.  CALEB OJEWALE
