Johnnie, Jazz & Whisky (JJW), platform for live afro-jazz performances, turned on the style as Adekunle Gold, Wande Coal and Lagbaja, the africalypso icon, mesmerized Lagos fans and audience in a scintillating fusion of music with the great flavours of Johnnie Walker Black Label. JJW guests were welcomed with cameras clicking away at the sensational ‘Johnnie Walker Lightbox’ for buzzworthy moments. Adekunle Gold soon opened the evening with exciting performances of favourites Ire, By You and Orente; giving way to the hugely anticipated Lagbaja, who did not disappoint with his powerful renditions of Never Far Away, Nothing For You and Konko Below. Wande Coal closed the extraordinary night with fine renditions of crowdpleasing hits, leaving the audience lingering on their feet in prolonged ovation. The highlight of the exciting showcase was the unveiling of The Johnnie Walker Highball Cocktail Serve, a fascinating new and easy way to enjoy the smooth flavours of Johnnie Walker Black Label. Guests were immersed in the delicious Johnnie Walker Highball Collection, flagged by Cola, Apple, Chapman, Pineapple and cocktail recipes. The Johnnie Walker Highball cocktail is more than just spirit and soda. It is an uplifting infusion of Johnnie Walker whiskies with simple fruits notes in a highball glass to minimize the loss of bubbles, preserving the distinct flavour that Orijin Zero comes with each refreshing sip. Whether you are a whisky lover or a complete novice, there is a Johnnie Walker highball for you.
