 The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) on Tuesday said its efforts to reconcile aggrieved aspirants in the recently held governorship party primaries in Kogi and Bayelsa states had yielded positive results. This is as the party explained that the reconciliation became imperative to ensure its victory in the November 16 Governorship elections. In Kogi State, two governorship aspirants, Senator Dino Melaye and Ibrahim Idris had petitioned against the conduct of the exercise that saw the emergence of Musa Wada as the flag bearer for the party, alleging that their votes were not counted. Also, in Bayelsa State, a former managing director of the Niger Delta Development Commission, Timi Alaibe, had challenged the emergence of Senator Douye Diri as PDP’s candidate in the state,  He alleged that the PDP primary in the state was manipulated and held through a flawed process. However, the PDP through the National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, in a statement said the party could not afford to watch grievances to destroy its grassroots structures in the two states ahead of the elections. “The party says its members and supporters have nothing to fear as reconciliatory efforts in the aftermath of the governorship primary elections in the two states are yielding immense results and further strengthening its structures and formation as one big, united and formidable family. “The PDP assures that it is leaving no stones unturned to ensure that all aggrieved members are appeased so that our party faces the elections as a family,” Ologbondiyan  stated. He further applauded the understanding and the spirit of sportsmanship being exhibited by critical stakeholders in the two states, as well as their commitment towards the success of the party at the elections.
