Sinatu Ojikutu, a former deputy governor in Lagos State, has congratulated President Muhammadu Buhari on his victory at the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal which affirmed his election on Wednesday. Ojikutu also urged President Buhari to work harder now towards ameliorating the suffering of the masses who gave him the mandate at the February poll. In a statement by her media office, Ojikutu maintained that the judgment was a victory for democracy which would take the country to the right direction. “This is a golden opportunity for PMB to bring out that quality which the people see in him that made us vote for him overwhelmingly,” She said. Ojikutu also advised that to revamp the economy the country needs to recover the funds inequitably distributed and looted through the convocation of the truth and restitution committee so that those who want to restitute and return what they have unjustly appropriated that belonged to the masses can do so without any delay. “So, let’s have a truth, restitution and recovery commission. A time frame should be given for people to come out willingly and return what they have acquired illicitly or unjustifiably according to the norms of a decent society. There is no justification for the extreme poverty in Nigeria,” She added. She also called on those around the presidency who are perceived to be tainted to be in tune with PMB and clean up their acts and also not do the business as usual in this ‘Next Level’ dispensation. The former deputy governor also warned those who are in the habit of getting kickbacks from contractors through contract inflation and those who are ripping the country off through unwholesome practices to desist forthwith.
