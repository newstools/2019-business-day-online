With primary focus on Fish feed, which accounts for over 70percent of total farm costs, Olam has invested in Sub-Saharan Africa’s largest and most advanced fish feed manufacturing facility in Ilorin, Kwara State. Olam’s aquaculture business is expected to employ 150 workers and create additional 200-250 indirect jobs. With an average size of 5,000 per smallholder farmer employing 4-5 people, the company’s fish feed investment could generate close to 70,00-80,000 jobs which could double if the current capacity is improved further. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates Nigeria’s annual fish consumption to be two million tons, with over 20 percent supplied through land-based aquaculture production.
