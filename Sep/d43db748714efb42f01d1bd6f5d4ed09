African entrepreneurs and manufacturers can now monetize and sell their courses online and get paid without hassles following the successful launch of Trainquaters in Nigeria. Trainquarters is a first of its kind, one-stop digital platform built to help African entrepreneurs from different sectors of the economy to monetize their knowledge. Stephanie Obi, founder and CEO of Trainquarters said at the formal launch in Lagos that from creating, marketing and selling online courses to building a website, email list, blog post hosting and more, the platform contains everything you need to launch an online course. She noted that the global market is worth $107 billion, stating that Nigeria was yet to benefit from this market despite a lot of potential and knowledge available in this country. On why she created the platform, Obi said: “I was tired of seeing Africans struggle with monetizing their knowledge online, so, I created a solution that is appropriate for Africans across the continent”. “The beauty of this is that you don’t need to be tech-savvy to use the platform!” she added. On the platform’s simplicity and ease of use, Obi added that “after working with over 200 women to create their online courses, we noticed a trend – The Tech! The tech is very scary. It is overwhelming and many times people feel stuck and disappointed. According to her, many of them wanted to impact lives but they gave up because of the tech. “We saw them struggling, which was hard to watch so we decided to help them make it easier.” “The all-in-one platform grants you access to online courses at a discounted rate – rather than paying for different platforms – along with the assistance of the support team to enlighten and guide you through the process.”
