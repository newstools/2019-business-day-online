With just a trading day left in the third quarter of 2019, analysts and other stakeholders in the nation’s capital market have started to fine-tune their strategies for the last quarter of the year and beyond. The Nigerian capital market year to date has defiled all projections with investors now opting for bargain hunting when the opportunities arise.

On the flip side, the All Share Index closed ended the week at 27,675.04 points, which amounted to a year to returns of -11.95 percent. The stocks listed under the Nigerian consumer goods remained the worst performing stocks, having shed 25.17 percent from their opening prices on January 1,2019.

And Oil and Gas index at -21.08 percent; Lotus Islamic Index at -20.90; Pension Index at -18.03 percent complete the list of sub sectoral indexes that have grossly underperformed year to date.
