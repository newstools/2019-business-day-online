We know the Sustainable Development Goals are not done on paper; you have to do practical things to create employability; and do something to save the planet. That is why we are really interested and happy to partner with Total this time again.” The two-year Project is expected to create employment, induce research and finally unbundle opportunities to small and medium scale enterprises.
