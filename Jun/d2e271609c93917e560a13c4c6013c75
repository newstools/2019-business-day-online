In line with the recent executive order issued by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, against indiscriminate waste dumping of waste, the Lagos Waste Management Authority (LAWMA) has flagged off an intensive waste evacuation operation tagged, “Lagos at 4am”, to tackle the menace
of improper waste disposal in the state. “The early morning operation is to enable us restore the state to the path of cleanliness and environmental sustainability. The operation starts by 4am; when we roll out our operational vehicles at strategic locations across the metropolis to sanitise the environment and mitigate waste challenges”, said Obinna Onyenali, spokesperson of LAWMA. Onyenali added that the authority would not leave any stone unturn in the quest to clean up black spots across the state and urged Lagosians to support efforts of the state government by avoiding indiscriminate dumping of waste and patronising their assigned PSP operators. Meanwhile, LAWMA has reiterated its commitment to tackling the challenge of environmental degradation in Apapa area of Lagos occasioned by the inaccessibility of the road for waste evacuation. “As you are well aware, we recently raised alarm over the deplorable state of the environment in Apapa which was majorly caused by utility vehicles blocking the roads, thus making it difficult for LAWMA trucks to operate in the area. “ However, we will intensify our efforts to clear backlogs of wastes dumped within the Apapa environment as traffic situation in the area improves”, said Onyenali.  Recall, LAWMA had recently called on the authorities in Apapa to speedy up the process of decongesting the roads to make it accessible for effective waste evacuation.
