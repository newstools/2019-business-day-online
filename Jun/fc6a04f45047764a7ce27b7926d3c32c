On 8th and 9th June Balmoral Convention Centre was abuzz with activity, as fashion enthusiasts flocked to patronise the various women-owned business at the XRetail: SheTrades Edition exhibition hosted by Style House Files and partners ITC SheTrades. SheTrades (www.shetrades.com), an initiative of the International Trade Centre (ITC), was established to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals, by connecting 3 million women to markets by 2021. The ITC ‘s SheTrades Initiative works with partners from around the world to create an ecosystem of integrated solutions that empower women economically through trade. ITC SheTrades through its activities, enables female entrepreneurs to improve the quality of their products and services and their support was actualised through this event. From beauty brands to fashion brands, Lagosians were spoilt for choice as 50 retailers displayed their products for old and new patrons alike. The event’s core purpose was achieved, as the female entrepreneurs were able to engage with the public and utilise the X Retail platform to further the interests of their businesses.
Commenting on the success of the event Omoyemi Akerele, Founder Style House Files & Lagos Fashion Week said” “This years XRetail was all about our female exhibitors and providing a platform for them to showcase their businesses. It was extremely gratifying to see shoppers being exposed to a wide variety of brands and also SHF’s key agenda of creating avenues for commerce play out during the two day event.” The next big event in the Nigerian fashion calendar is Lagos Fashion Week! Dates for this years Lagos Fashion Week were revealed at the event and from October 23rd to 26th some of Africa’s top designers will present their collections at Balmoral Federal Palace Hotel.
