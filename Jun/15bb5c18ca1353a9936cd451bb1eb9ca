Real Madrid have completed the signing of Luka Jovic from Eintracht Frankfurt on a deal until 2025. The 21-year-old Serbia international emerged as one of the most sought-after talents in European football during the 2018-19 campaign. Jovic will wear the famous white Real Madrid shirt next season after his former club Eintracht Frankfurt confirmed the striker moves to LaLiga on a five year deal. Eintracht sporting director Fredi Bobic stated: “On a sporting front, Luka Jovic leaving is a big loss for us. His explosiveness and scoring skills have spread throughout Europe and we’ve benefited not only from his goals over the past two years. But for us it was clear that there is a financial pain threshold. For Eintracht Frankfurt this is a good transfer. We wish Luka only the best for his future. He has the best qualifications for a great career. And we are proud that we were able to support him along the way.” Jovic took Germany and Europe by storm last season with 27 goals and seven assists.Many other clubs were interested, but Real Madrid moved ahead of the pack. He is a goalscorer who can help out Benzema, as he is a great finisher and is also great in the air. With Eder Militao and Rodrygo already signed and Eden Hazard and Ferland Mendy on the way, Real Madrid‘s summer has started well.  Anthony Nlebem
