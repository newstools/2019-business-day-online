The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has announced that it will today, Tuesday launch a new flagship health activity that will help five states in Nigeria improve access to primary health care services, essential commodities, and increase demand for services. This was disclosed in a statement issued on Tuesday morning by the Public Affairs Division of the US Embassy in Abuja, stressing that the five -year, $225 million Integrated Health Programme (IHP) would be implemented in Bauchi, Kebbi and Sokoto, with two more states to be added soon. IHP will contribute to revitalizing primary health care by helping the state health systems upgrade clinics and employ an integrated model for a full complement of high-quality round-the-clock health services in every ward. Bauchi State Governor Bala Mohammed, Kebbi State Governor Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, and Sokoto State Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal will all participate in the unveiling of the initiative. The USAID has been at the forefront among agencies striving to reduce challenges of health and poverty in Nigeria.
