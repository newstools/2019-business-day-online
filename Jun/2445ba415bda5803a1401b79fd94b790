The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has begged the international community not to abandon Nigeria, saying that its next generation may not witness democracy going by the current events in the country. The PDP Deputy National Chairman, Yemi Akinwonmi, who stated this when the European Union Election Observer delegation paid a visit to the party in Abuja, said the country is drifting into a military dictatorship. The EU observer mission was led by Maria Arena. Speaking on behalf of the PDP national chairman, Uche Secondus, Akinwonmi said they invited the mission because “we have lost confidence in the Nigerian electoral process and it is unfortunate.” He said: “Our doors are always open to you. If you leave us alone the generation coming after us may not witness democracy. We encourage you to come as a last hope of our democracy.” While he assured that the party would study and implement the recommendations of the EU team, he added “There is absolutely nothing to improve upon. We are drifting to the dark days of military junta.” The deputy national chairman who accused INEC and the security agencies of compromising the electoral process, added that “when the trial begins at the election petition tribunal, we will show the world the atrocities that the ruling government did.” He lamented that the poverty has taken over the polity, stressing that expatriates are leaving the country in droves. Speaking earlier, Chief Observer of the EU delegation Maria Arena, who said there will always be room for improvement of democracy, noted that they made over 30 recommendations to how to improve the Democratic process in Nigeria. She noted that there will be no improvement if there is non-political will, adding that there is need to start the process of reforms early, have very inclusive discussion and understanding from all electoral stakeholders as well as ensure more women get involved in the electoral process.
