In a statement signed by the National Coordinator, Uche Okoronkwo and Secretary, Isiaka Mohammed on Saturday said the interest of the group is to ensure enthronement of good governance, transparency and accountability in the delivery of public goods at all levels in Nigeria. It said “in fulfilling our mandate, we have followed with keen interest the trajectory and track records of those who have been appointed to or offered themselves for public service offices in Nigeria, x-raying their competence, fitness and suitability to hold such offices. “Our attention was, therefore, recently drawn to an investigative report by a news medium, Corruption Reporters, which shed light on the antecedents of one of the leaders of the outgoing 8th National Assembly and an aspirant to the office of Speaker of the Federal House of Representatives for the 9th Assembly, in the person of Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila.” CSOs asked members of the House of Representatives to elect a new Speaker based on competence and corrupt-free track records of the contenders.  James Kwen, Abuja
