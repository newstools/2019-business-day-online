Rafael Nadal defeated Roger Federer 6-3 6-4 6-2 to reach a 12th French Open final and end a five-match losing streak against the Swiss. Organizers must have been relieved the predicted rain in Paris stayed away but Mother Nature intervened in another way Friday, whipping up a huge breeze that caused havoc in the dynamic duo’s 39th meeting. The 11-time champion dismissed his great rival Roger Federer for the sixth straight time on the Paris clay. The 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory was his 14th from 16 matches on the terre battue and snapped a five-match losing streak to the Swiss. It was his first victory over Federer in more than five years. Wild winds left the court swirling with clay dust, the odd Panama hat and ball kids scampering to gather wayward geranium petals throughout the match. In the pair’s 39th showdown, Nadal left Federer scrambling with few answers to his mastery of the clay. More than two years had passed since one of their greatest tussles and their last in a Grand Slam: the match to decide the 2017 Australian Open. This, however, was never at risk of going the distance. Nadal raised his arms victorious for the 24th time against the 37-year-old. Federer raised his arms to applaud his appreciation as he strolled from the court. Whether it was his Paris farewell remains to be seen.
