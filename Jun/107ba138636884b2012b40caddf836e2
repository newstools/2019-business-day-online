The immediate past governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha, on Thursday took his oath of office as senator representing Imo West in the National Assembly. The development brings the number senators in the Ninth Senate to 108. Out of this number, All Progressives Congress (APC) has 63 senators, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) 44 and Young Progressive Party (YPP) one. Okorochaâ€™s swearing-in followed the issuance of Certificate of Return to him by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Tuesday. The Commission had earlier denied him the certificate on the grounds that his declaration as a senator-elect was made under duress. However, an Abuja High Court had ordered the Commission to issue him the certificate. The swearing-in was done by the Clerk of the Senate, Nelson Ayewoh, as President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, presided over the session.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
