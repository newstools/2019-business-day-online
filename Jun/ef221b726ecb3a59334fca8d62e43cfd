The FUTA Tigers lead Group A in the ongoing Higher Institutions Football League (HiFL), following a 1:0 win over EKSU Mountaineers at the sports complex of the University of Lagos (Unilag) on Wednesday. The team from Federal University, Akure, FUTA Tigers, came into the game with great enthusiasm, after being held to a one-all draw by UNILAG Marines in the opening Group A game. FUTA dictated the play from the start, but wasted a number of chances until Oyeleke Oluwatobi, with jersey number 13, secured a desired goal for the Tigers in the 12th minute. EKSU Mountaineersâ€™s search for an equalizer, yielded no result, as solid defender, Chizoba Benjamin, commandeered the defense with great composure, rendering the EKSU advances futile. Elsewhere in the University of Benin, UNIBEN Royals showed superiority against the team from Federal University Ndufu Alike Ikwo, FUNAI Hawks. Ezekiel Udiomuno and Jesse Ijomah scored in the 36th and 37th minutes respectively to clinch a 2:0 win for UNIBEN Royals, the victory takes the lads from Benin to the top of Group E.
