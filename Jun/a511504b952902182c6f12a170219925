However, investors seem not to be impressed enough despite the impressive showing by the listed companies particularly in the top three sub sectors. The All Share Index ended the week in the negative territory as it closed at -4.40 year to date. The main board index posted even worse performance as it ended the week at -14.15 percent year to date. Analysts are unanimous that the equities listed on the Nigerian Stock Exchange hold much promise for investors. This is because most of the listed stocks presently trade at a discount. “Dividend is a strong driver of investors’ sentiment. However, a poor dividend payment cannot be attributed as the sole dragger of the market’s performance. It is barely two years after we exited recession and hence we expect to see most companies recapitalising along their growth path. To help such companies, an increase in the flow of credit to the private sector at affordable rates will go a long way. “These companies will be faced with fewer pressures towards the need to capitalise earnings as they have alternative means of funding and this could in turn provide available cash for dividend payment”, Chinonye Nnewuihe, senior analyst with Meristem Securities, said. Sectors that accounted for less than one percent of the total dividends in 2018 include agric, aviation, construction, healthcare, ICT, hotels, insurance, manufacturing, mortgage banking, as well as paints and chemicals.
