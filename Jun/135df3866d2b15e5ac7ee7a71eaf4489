Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo -Olu, says the state government is looking to collaborating with the Federal Government to fix collapsed sections of the Lagos-Badagry Expressway. The express road has not only become a national embarrassment but a death trap. Thousands of commuters and motorists plying the road are daily cramped in traffic jams, worsened by deep potholes and craters that have developed along the abandoned sections of the road. Movement on the road is particularly pathetic around the Lagos International Trade Fair Complex, stretching to Barracks bus stop, Volks and Iyana-Iba axis, as the contractor engaged by Lagos State government in its bid to expand the road, had long left site due to non-payment by the state. But Sanwo-Olu, who took a tour of the road on Sunday, said the State government would work towards completing the road from Maza-Maza to Okokomaiko before the end of this year. Sanwo-Olu, who addressed journalists, also assured that there would be a major clean-up of the road from National Theatre at Iganmu to Maza-Maza, urging traders displaying goods on the road to halt their illegal activities. “We would ensure that the commerce in the western axis of Lagos come back to life; that is why we have come here,” he said. Sanwo-Olu said that the state government would partner with the Federal Government to find a lasting solution to the road from Okokomaiko, Agbara to Seme-boarder.
