The urban population in Nigeria grow is growing at 4.6% per annum and by implication, an increasing number of Nigerians participate in the cash economy and have become consumers. However, one would expect players in the nation’s FMCG to enjoy booming sales and profitability. Sadly, this is not the case. The last recession, the worst in 25years left consumers with shrinking wallet, while manufacturers are left to bear the growing cost of operation as they could not pass the cost to the already cash-strapped consumers. Also, the economic headwinds left several FMCGs struggling to find their footing, while few have been able to triumph and shine in the midst of economic adversity, thus conferring the tag of Primus inter pares (first among equals) on them.

The company also source most of its raw materials like sorghum, maize, soya beans, sugar, cocoa, and cassava locally” Market Performance Nestle’s performance at the domestic bourse in underpinned by weak investors’ sentiment. Investors are snubbing the attractive earnings figures churned out by corporates and looking up to the Buhari-led administration to formulate market-moving reforms that would revive the bourse. Its shares declined N20 or 1.38 percent to close at N1, 430 after Friday’s trading session, down 3.7 percent since the beginning of the year. The food product giant outperformed the broader market index and consumer goods sector that has returned 4.4 percent and 37.2 percent losses respectively.

Currently, 80 percent of the company’s input is sourced locally while 100 percent of the grains and legumes used in the production of GoldenMorn is sourced locally. This has tremendously helped over 30,000 local farmers to improve on their farm inputs to meet Nestle’s high quality standard and also provides a steady source of income for the farmers.
