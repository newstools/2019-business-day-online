The European Union (EU) Election Observer Mission to Nigeria is set to present its final report and recommendations to the Senate on Tuesday. In a letter to the President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, dated June 14, 2019, the EU Mission said the meeting is aimed at urging the National Assembly to work with other stakeholders on the need for electoral reforms ahead of the 2023 general election. It was gathered that the meeting is billed to hold at the Senate President’s Conference Room, Third Floor, Senate New Wing by 12:30pm. The letter seen by BusinessDay and signed by Ketil Karlsen, head of the delegation reads: “The purpose of the meeting would be to present a copy of the report and recommendations of the EU Observer Mission to you as we work with Nigerian authorities and all stakeholders to begin a conversation on how to continue to improve electoral administration in Nigeria. “We also look to use the opportunity to begin to engage with your good self and offices on the wider EU support to the National Assembly on a range of issues including but not limited to institutional building”. Presenting the final report on the February 23 and March 2 general election at the weekend in Abuja, the EU Observer Mission noted that the last elections won by President Muhammadu Buhari and his All Progressives Congress (APC) were not transparent and were marred by violence and harassment of voters. “The elections became increasingly marred by violence and intimidation, with the role of the security agencies becoming more contentious as the process progressed. This damaged the integrity of the electoral process and may deter future participation,” it noted.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
