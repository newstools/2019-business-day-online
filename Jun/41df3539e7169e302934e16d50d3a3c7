Count down to the inauguration of the 9th Assembly, Femi Gbajabiamila, the anointed candidate of the All Progressives Congress, APC for the position of Speaker of House of Representatives is confident of victory. Gbajabiamila became even more confident following his endorsement by 183 members-elect under the auspices of â€˜Forum of First Term Members of House of Representatives on Saturday in Abuja. Led by Olubumi Tunji-Ojo, the members across the six geopolitical zones took turns to announce and stamp their endorsement and support for Gbajabiamila and Ahmed Wase, the Deputy Speaker candidate. In his speech, Gbajabiamila said him and Wase have gotten the endorsement of the President, the party, Nigerians, members across party lines and they were now sure of victory. The Speakership candidate said it has become imperative for the legislature to have competent and well experienced lawmaker to implement a developmental legislative agenda. He said he would ensure synergy between the legislature and executive arms of governments to foster democratic stability and good governance. According to Gbajabiamila, he has the requisite legislative experience to build on the gains of the 8th House to build growth and impact rapid development to constituents and country. On his part, Director General of Gbajabiamila/Wase campaign organization, Abdulmuminin Jibril said the endorsement was massive and that for the first termers to come together indicated that the candidature of Gbajabiamila would transform the legislative House. According to him, all antics deployed by opposition parliamentarians to discredit and denigrate the image of Gbajabiamila, and to frustrate his emergence as speaker have failed woefully.
