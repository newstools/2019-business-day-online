Bolt, an on-demand transportation platform that operates in seven Nigerian cities, has launched Bolt for Business, allowing companies of all sizes to manage and pay for corporate trips via a single, easy-to-use portal.
This addition to the Bolt range of services broadens the positive impact of on-demand transport for businesses, as companies can now democratise access to jobs by removing the ‘own transport required’ condition for employment, and have access to a simple service offering for employees and clients alike. They can do this by allocating a monthly budget through the Bolt platform to individual employees, ensuring that all employees who travel for business enjoy the benefits of affordable and reliable personal transport without the often prohibitive costs associated with vehicle ownership.
In a statement sent by the company Tuesday, it stated that it had launched Bolt for Business after noticing that a growing number of Bolt trips were taken for business purposes during working hours, whether it was commuting to work, rushing to client meetings or getting to the airport,” says Uche Okafor, regional manager for Bolt West Africa. “In a country with unreliable public transport and high costs of car ownership, Bolt for Business offers a convenient and cost-efficient solution to business travel. It also provides an alternative transport option for the many young people entering the workplace, who cannot yet afford their own vehicle, or who actively choose to not buy a car.
“In addition, Bolt for Business is the perfect solution for entrepreneurs and SMEs, where time is money and hours spent in traffic can be put to better use if someone else – like a driver on the Bolt platform – is driving,” the statement read. Bolt for Business is available in more than 30 markets across Europe and Africa.
Bolt, formerly known as Taxify, is the leading European transportation platform focused on making urban travel easier, quicker and more reliable.
