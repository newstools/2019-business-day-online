As part of its efforts to increase patronage at the Eastern Ports, the management of the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) has approved 10 percent discount on harbour dues for ships calling all concession terminals at the Eastern Ports. The ports that will benefit from this initiative include Calabar, Rivers and Delta Ports, said Jatto Adams, general manager, Corporate and Strategic Communications of the NPA in statement sent to BusinessDay. “The Authority however wishes to clarify that this discount will only apply to harbour dues payable by the following types of vessels/cargoes: Container vessels with at least 250 Twenty-foot Equivalent Units (TEUs); general cargo vessels with at least 16,000 Metric Tons (MT); combo vessels with at least 16,000 MT and RORO vessels with at least 250 units of vehicles. According to Jatto, the discounts shall not apply to vessels coming in ballast; vessels calling at private jetties and vessels carrying liquid bulk. He further said that the application of the discount will take effect immediately. Recall that stakeholders have called on government agencies operating in the nation’s seaports to review tariff and charges on ships calling ports in the Eastern part of the country with imported cargo to encourage effective utilisation and patronage of these ports.
