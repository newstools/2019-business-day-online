The Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN) has notified airlines, airport users and the general public that effective Friday June 7, 2019, the Murtala Muhammed International Airport’s Apron Gate 1 and some sections of Taxiway F would be closed to human and vehicular traffic for six weeks. The authority said the closure was to enable the contractor handling the construction of the new terminal (China Civil Construction Company) link the proposed apron under construction with the existing one. “To maintain orderliness and ensure safety of operators while the project would last, the Authority has developed and deployed specific procedures for vehicular movements and officers of the Aviation Security department have been mobilized to ensure compliance. “The Authority will like to solicit the understanding and cooperation of all concerned towards ensuring a safe airside for aircraft movement and personnel safety during the construction,” Henrietta Yakubu, General Manager, Corporate Affairs, said.
