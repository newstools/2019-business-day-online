House of Representatives Speaker Femi Gbajabiamila, on Monday said he will run an open government and appoint members of the opposition political parties into Ariosto committees in the House of Representatives. The Speaker disclosed this while fielding questions from State House Correspondents onMonday, after meeting with Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The Speaker who was responding to a question on how he will treat members of the opposition parties after the recently keenly contested elections, declared that he has already inaugurated the committee that will share offices, adding that “the committees would be unfolded in the next few weeks and you will see how we intend to carry them along . He however stated that he will not preempt the decision of the committee, but assured that he was prepared to carry the opposition along “I don’t want to let the cat out of the bag but you can be assured they would be carried along” Gbajabiamila who stated that the meeting was about the economy and how to move the country forward, said it was part of a way of charting a road map about how to confront the problems that are facing Nigeria. “So, It wasn’t a personal meeting but you can call it a hybrid – between the personal and official but mostly it’s official. How the executive and the legislature can collaborate to make life better for Nigeria and Nigerians” Asked what Nigerians are going to see differently from his leadership of the ninth Assembly, especially under his headship, the Speaker said, “Stay tune, you’ve heard my inaugural speech, we are going to do things differently, we are going to build on whatever the achievements are of the eight assembly, and it’s going to be a reformed house “Like I have said, the reform will be fished out in piece meal so as not to shock the system. But they will be reforms that will be for the benefit of the country. We expect the cooperation of all facets of government, including the executive and you – the journalists and including our constituents.” he said.  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
