The Ninth Senate held its first plenary on Thursday and rejected its first motion. The session which was presided over by the new Senate President, Ahmad Lawan, started around 10:30am. In the absence of a substantive Majority Leader of the Senate, its deputy president, Ovie Omo-Agege acted in that capacity, pending when the leadership will be fully constituted. Recall that the Ninth Senate had its inaugural session on Tuesday, following a proclamation issued by President Muhammadu Buhari. However, in its first major move, the upper legislative chamber rejected a motion raised through a Point of Order by a Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Istifanius Dung Giang, urging the Senate to debate the speech of President Buhari delivered on Wednesday, during the maiden Democracy Day programme on June 12. He said: “On Tuesday, the President gave a speech during the celebration of June 12 Democracy Day. In the speech, he said so many things. I think we should look…” However, he was interrupted by Lawan who insisted that the issue in question must be approved by the Senate before it could be discussed. When it was subjected to a voice vote, it was overwhelmingly rejected. Several attempts by the senator to revive the issue was ignored by the Senate President. Meanwhile, the Senate has formally sent a message to President Buhari; Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila; International Parliamentary bodies; and Secretary to Government of the Federation (SGF), Boss Mustapha. The recognition of Mustapha as SGF was questioned by Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo from Bayelsa. He said since President Buhari was yet to reappoint and swear-in a substantive SGF, the message should be addressed to the office instead. Again, Lawan rejected the suggestion, adding that the Senate must do everything within its powers to nurture a good working relationship with the Executive arm of government.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
