As Nigerian content creators find more ways to get creative and monetize their presence on YouTube, the video streaming service has kicked off a whole week of activities to recognize creators who are performing well, and providing support for their improvement through a boot camp. In BusinessDay interactions with some creators, it was revealed that many have found content creation as a way to beat unemployment, earning a living while also doing things they enjoy. In the course of the week, Gold Play Buttons will be awarded to channels that have reached the one million-subscriber mark, and Silver to those which have garnered 100,000 subscribers. On Monday, Nigerian music artiste, D’banj, picked up a Silver Play Button in recognition of achieving 100,000 subscriptions to his YouTube channel, while Neptune3 Studios, 2Baba Idibia, Teni and Adekunle Gold are to receive similar awards. Flavour, whose channel has crossed the one million-subscriber mark, will be picking up a Gold Play Button. The YouTube platform, for many content creators, started as a platform where they could find expressions with their hobbies. However, as previously reported by BusinessDay, it has become a platform where they are paid for their creative efforts, and beyond this, one that has showcased them to a clientele base, sponsors and brands they never would have secured on their own. In supporting the ecosystem of content creators to grow, a week-long bootcamp for YouTube Creators started on Monday and will culminate in a graduation ceremony and wrap party on Friday, 21 June. The Bootcamp covers topics like channel & content strategy, working with brands, creator responsibility, production, and accelerating growth on YouTube. A public YouTube Masterclass will be held on Saturday, for registered participants. “Nigeria has a culture that is steeped in sharing and storytelling, and Nigerians are passionate about music, entertainment and education,” said Addy Awofisayo, YouTube partnerships manager. “Since its launch in Nigeria in 2011, we’ve provided a platform for Nigerians to share the country’s unique and diverse culture on a global stage, and also offer Nigerian users more relevant content. Over 5000 hours of content are uploaded to YouTube every minute, noted Awofisayo. According to her, what happens on YouTube is a reflection of what is important and relevant to the world. YouTube has a large and passionate community where people gather and express themselves, share experiences, and reflect on what they think about and care about moment to moment. In the course of the week, YouTube Nigeria premiered new original series including the D’Banj’s ‘Adventures KokoMaster’ series, on Monday, the ‘Brotherhood’ series premiere from Accelerate TV on Tuesday, the SceneOne ‘Ayetoro’ series premiere on Wednesday and today, it will host an evening with Tuface Idibia (2Baba).
