Nigerians will be able to lift its nation’s crude oil for export if the national fleet comes into operation, Dakuku Peterside, director general of the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has assured. Peterside, who was speaking at a breakfast meeting on the sideline of the ongoing Nor Shipping Conference and Exhibition in Oslo, Norway, said the establishment of national shipping lines will end capital flight, associated with the present arrangement of selling oil on free on board (FoB) basis to customers. While assuring that it will also lead to employment creation, he said the new national fleet will be owned 49 percent by a technical partner and the remaining 51 percent will be reserved for Nigerian investors. According to him, Nigerian investors will hold equity in lots to avoid having domineering shareholder. He however stated the planned national fleet will be private sector led to ensure sustainability and profitability. He listed the assets to include patrol boats, special mission aircrafts, helicopters, unmanned air vessels and special mission ships, adding that the assets, acquired under the ‘Deep Blue Project’, which he described as homeland security solution that will be operational by September this year. Peterside however called on investors to tap into the rich potentials of the maritime sector in Nigeria, adding the government has incentivised the sector with offers of tax holidays and institutional support. “Nigeria is an investment friendly environment with comprehensive maritime security, a robust financial sector and six port complexes with numerous terminals, and is focusing on implementing reforms to enhance ease of doing business,” he said.
