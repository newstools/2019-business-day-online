Workers at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Monday morning shut down the office premises over attempts to reinstate suspended DG, Mounir Gwarzo. BusinessDay gathered that the Association of Senior Civil Servants of Nigeria, SEC Branch, locked up offices of the Headquarters of the Commission. The Union is protesting attempts to reinstate the suspended Director General of SEC, Mounir Gwarzo. Gwarzo had been indicted for abuse of office and corruption by an Administrative Panel of Inquiry set up by the Federal Ministry of Finance headed by the Permanent Secretary, Dr. Mahmoud Isa-Dutse. Gwarzo was also indicted by the House of Representatives Ad-Hoc Committee which investigated his suspension by the former Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun. However, an industrial court in Abuja last Thursday dismissed the three issues raised again the embattled DG and ordered his immediate reinstatement.  Onyinye Nwachukwu, Abuja
