Liverpool defeated Tottenham 2-0 to win their sixth Champions League title in Madrid, thanks to an early goal from Mohamed Salah and late goal from Divock Origi. Less than two minutes of play, Salah smashed in his spot-kick after Moussa Sissoko had been penalised for handball in the area. Sadio Mané’s cross struck first the chest of the France midfielder and then his right arm, which was out in front of him, pointing. The referee, Damir Skomina, pointed to the spot after only 22 seconds. Salah struck the ball just off centre to Hugo Lloris’s left. The goalkeeper went the right way but the shot had far too much power. The win at the Wanda Metropolitano was sweet redemption for Salah and especially Klopp, who had suffered defeat in his last six major finals, including Champions League showpieces with Borussia Dortmund in 2013 and Liverpool last year. “I am so happy for the boys all these people, and my family. They suffer for me, they deserve it more than anybody,” said the elated German. “Did you ever see a team like, this, fighting with no fuel in the tank? And we have a keeper (Alisson Becker) who makes difficult things look easy. It is the best night of our professional lives.” His opposite number Mauricio Pochettino praised his team’s determined efforts to get themselves back into the game. “We were fighting, and we played so well in the second half. I feel so proud, a little bit unlucky. To be 1-0 down from the start was tough, we changed our plans but we are very proud of these players and these fans. We can be optimistic.” Perhaps the occasion was just too much for Tottenham in their first ever appearance in the Champions League final. Mauricio Pochettino’s decision to start Harry Kane after nearly two months out did not pay off, and he is still looking for his first trophy after five years in charge.
