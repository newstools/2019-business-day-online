 This became obvious following the inauguration of three ad-hoc committees by Femi Gbajabiamila, Speaker of the House of Representatives on Monday. These are: Ad-hoc Committee on Selection chaired by Gbajabiamila; Adhoc Committee on Welfare chaired by Wale Raji (APC-Lagos) and Ad-hoc Committee on Media chaired by Khadijat Bukar Abba-Ibrahim (APC-Yobe). The Speaker urged all members who are interested in specific Standing Committees in which they have core competence to submit their curriculum vitae (CVs) for consideration. Gbajabiamila who was in company of his Deputy, Idris Wase, during the inauguration of the three ad-hoc Committees charged members to justify the trust and confidence reposed in them to serve in various steering committees for effective take-off of legislative activities. According to the Speaker,  the inauguration of the three Ad-hoc Committees was a major phase critical to running the Lower Chamber. While stressing the need for timely conclusion of various assignments ahead of July 2 resumption date, he urged the Welfare Ad-hoc Committee to “take it very seriously.” He explained that the allocation of offices and Chamber seats would be carried out with himself and Deputy Speaker in line with extant tradition. The terms of reference of the Ad-hoc Committee on Welfare include: allocation of offices and chairs in the Lower Chambers to all the 360 members putting into consideration their ranking status.
