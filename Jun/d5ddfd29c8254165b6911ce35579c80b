Fidelix Onyebueke, a legal expert and constitutional lawyer, has predicted that the fortunes enjoyed by the ruling party, the All Progressives Congress (APC), shall seize to exist after the administration of President Mohammadu Buhari administration. Onyebueke says the goodwill enjoyed by the party in 2019 general election will no more be there after the tenure of the President in 2023. Speaking to BusuinessDay in an exclusive interview in his office, the legal luminary also predicted that before 2023, both APC and the opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) shall come together to form  another party that will take over power . “Buhari brought life to APC, if not, they couldn’t have gotten up to eight states in the 2019 general election and the way he handles the party, is the same way he
handles the affairs of the country,” he said.According to Onyebueke,“Reasonable people in this country have said that there is no alternative to Buhari and he knows how to use power. He understands Nigeria very well; he is doing it at his own pace. “On the recommendation to the President for the creation of state police by the executive secretary of the National Human Rights Commission, Tony Ojukwule Presidential Committee, Oyebueke said the system will create more grassroots criminals than the governors are doing now “State police is not the issue, if the police wants to do their jobs, they will do it; the police chiefs are not sincere, when we watch them giving change to drivers and nothing happens. We are not yet ripe for state and local government police, if not, you will see more of political assassinations across the country,” he said.
