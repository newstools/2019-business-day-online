The National Working Committee, NWC of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has set up a five-man Disciplinary Committee headed by Otunba Niyi Adebayo to investigate the allegations leveled by Lawal Shuaibu, the party’s Deputy National Chairman (North) against the National Chairman, Adam Oshiomhole. Lawal had in a letter last week accused Oshiomhole of being responsible for the sacking of APC candidates that won the 2019 elections in Zamfara State and failures of party in the aftermath of last polls and called for his resignation. APC NWC announced this at the end of its 38th regular meeting held on 27th May, 28th May 2019 and 6th June, 2019 which considered several issues, among which was the state of the Party. Lanre Issa- Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary Thursday night said, “after extensive deliberation, the NWC resolved to: pass a vote of confidence on the National Chairman, Comrade Adams Aliyu Oshiomhole “Set up a five-man Disciplinary Committee headed by Otunba Niyi Adebayo to investigate: the allegation leveled by Sen. Lawal Shuaibu against the National Chairman on issues involving the collective decisions of the National Working Committee. “The instigation of Senators/Members of the House of Representatives by Senator Lawal Shuaibu against the decision of the Party on the choice of the Presiding Officers for both chambers (Senate and the House of Representatives) at the banquet Hall, Presidential Villa, even when these issues were all discussed and agreed by all members of the National Working Committee (NWC). “Sen. Lawal Shuaibu’s action was particularly embarrassing by moving around the Senators/Members of the House of Representatives to revolt while Mr. President was making his concluding remarks on the need for APC to present one candidate to avoid a divided house. “The Committee is mandated to submit its report to the National Working Committee within 7 days from today”.
