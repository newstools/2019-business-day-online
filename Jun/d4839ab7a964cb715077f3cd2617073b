Barely one week when Andy Ruiz Jr stopped Joshua in the seventh round to become the new Heavyweight World Champion, the American-Mexican boxer has demanded a whooping sum of £40 million for a rematch with Nigerian born British boxer Anthony Joshua in the UK. Ruiz, the huge underdog sprung a shock last weekend to drop Joshua four times before stopping him in the seventh round. AJ immediately triggered the rematch clause with the second fight due to take place in November or December. Cardiff’s Principality Stadium is the frontrunner to host the second installment with Madison Square Garden and the T-Mobile Arena also in the frame. Ruiz is likely to pick up £10m for the rematch, double his purse for his first clash with Joshua – but he is ready to demand more. “Right now my team, they are negotiating everything right now. I have just got to stay busy, stay healthy and be ready for the rematch,” Ruiz told Fight Hub. “I would love it to be here in the United States or in Mexico you know. It all depends on the team and what they negotiate. “If they want me to go over there (UK), they have to give me $50million. If they want to come over here… It’s just negotiations you know.” Ruiz is keen to host the fight in Mexico, but that is highly unlikely with the terms of the rematch already agreed through the original contract. And Joshua is confident he will reclaim his place at the top of the heavyweight division. “Congratulations to Andy Ruiz, he has six months to be champion because the belts go in the air and he is going to have to defend against myself,” Joshua said. “I would not mind if it was in New York again, I wouldn’t mind if it’s in England. New York opened their arms for my team and me and it was phenomenal. I have to correct what went wrong and get the job done in the rematch.”
