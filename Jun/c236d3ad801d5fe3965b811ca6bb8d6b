Controversy over the existence or otherwise of a server in the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), assumed a new dimension on Tuesday as the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) accused the electoral body of colluding with the All Progressives Congress (APC) to distort facts on the matter. A statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, called that “an amorphous group parading as Forum of Presidential Candidates of the 2019 Elections and National Party Chairmen” had been hurriedly put together by INEC and the APC to misrepresent fact on the issue which is pending before the court. The statement reads in parts:
“This group, our investigation reveals, was hurriedly conjured by leadership of INEC and the All Progressives Congress (APC) to assist them in distorting facts, and making misrepresentations on a matter that are already subjudice, all in their attempt to clean up INEC’s blunders on the existence of the server, sway judicial pronouncements and influence public opinion on extant matters in court” The PDP invited Nigerians to note that “the press release by this nebulous group emerged after INEC’s several blunders while the Presidency has already admitted that the claim by the PDP and millions of Nigerians that INEC had a server wherein it stored results of the 2019 elections, “constitutes the fulcrum” of contention in the Presidential election.” According to the PDP, Nigerians are already aware of the existence of the server, which was duly budgeted for, set up in various INEC offices and in which data from the elections, including results, were stored” “Moreover, the ruling of the Court of Appeal preventing the PDP from inspecting the server does not in any way obviate the existence of the said server.” it added. The PDP advised that “instead of engaging in this unnecessary media trial, INEC should have listed its nebulous group as witness in the election tribunal” The opposition party challenge INEC to confront the indictment contained in the reports of the European Union and other international agencies which showed evidence that the 2019 general elections were marred by irregularities and violation of rules by the Commission. ” The party said it was” unfortunate that at a time when the Chairman of INEC, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, ought to be apologizing to Nigerians for the failure of the commission he leads to conduct a credible, free and fair election, a mass electoral failure consequent upon which the nation has over 766 election cases across the country, his commission is now contracting faceless groups to launder its sinking image and pass a confidence vote on Yakubu.” The PDP further counselled INEC “to own up to its failures put an end to its consistent denials on the existence of the server as justice will be served at the end of the day”  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
