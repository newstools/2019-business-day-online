The Director of Public Relations and Information, Air Commodore Ibikunle Daramola, who made the disclosure in a statement, said details of the crash were still sketchy. This was as Daramola insisted that no life was lost. He further disclosed that the Chief of the Air Staff (CAS), Air Marshal Sadique Abubakar, has directed the setting up of a board of Inquiry to establish the cause (s) of the incident. Daramola said: “A Nigerian Air Force (NAF) Helicopter has crashed in the process of landing while returning from an anti-armed banditry combat mission in the Northwest Theatre under Operation Hadaran Daji. Details of the cause of the incident, which occurred at the Katsina Airport at about 3.30pm today, 12 June 2019, are still scanty.
