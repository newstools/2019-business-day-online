The Nigeria Police Force  has debunked report of imminent terror attack, which was issued by the United Kingdom Foreign and Commonwealth Office, warning its citizens to avoid travelling to some states and border areas of Nigeria. The police in a statement issued on Wednesday by its Public Relations Officer Frank Mba, said while the Nigeria Police acknowledge that Nigeria is not without some security challenges, just like other nations of the World, including the advanced democracies it restated that Nigeria remains one of the most beautiful places to live in the World. “Nigeria is a safe country with its own peculiar socio-economic and security challenges.  We therefore wish to reassure Nigerians and the International Community of their safety and the commitment of the Police and other security agencies to continue to provide effective security services to the nation,” the statement added.
