Police in Rio de Janeiro police says it will open an investigation into Brazil and PSG superstar Neymar in relation to the release of intimate photos allegedly of the woman who has accused the footballer of rape, according to Spanish media AS. On Sunday, Rio police’s Department against Computer Crimes said in a statement that it is going to investigate the disclosure of intimate images in a video posted by Neymar to his Instagram account. In the video Neymar revealed a series of conversations and photographs allegedly shared by the pair on WhatsApp since their first meeting in March, as a means to protest his innocence. “I’m being accused of rape which is a strong word and what I’m going through at present is unpleasant. Anyhow, I want to show the conversations that were held between myself and this woman, all of our intimate communication, which is necessary to show what really occurred. What happened behind closed doors was a typical intimate relationship between a man and a woman”, the player said in the video. But his decision to reveal the intimate images may now land him in trouble with the Brazilian authorities. In Brazil it is a crime to offer, share, transmit, sell, distribute or publish images or videos of sexual content by any means without the consent of the subject of the video, with the crime carrying a penalty of up to five years in prison. The possibility of a longer sentence can occur in the case of a violation being deemed an act of revenge after a sexual relationship – or so-called ‘revenge porn’. Neymar is currently training with the Brazil national team in the Brazilian municipality of Teresópolis ahead of the Copa América, which starts in June 14 in the country. Before his arrival by helicopter at the Teresópolis training centre earlier this Sunday, police authorities were spotted at the premises, but it is unknown if their visit was related to Neymar.
