In a move which is in accordance with constitutional provisions, Governor Sanwo-Olu, approved the nomination of Justice Alogba, who is the most senior judge in line, to preside over the state’s judiciary in acting capacity, pending the approval of the National Judicial Council (NJC) and confirmation by the Lagos State House of Assembly. In a statement by his Deputy Chief Press Secretary, Gboyega Akosile, Sanwo-Olu said Alogba’s appointment would take effect from Tuesday, June 11, noting that the instant appointment of the Acting Chief Judge was necessary to prevent a vacuum in the State’s judiciary. “In accordance with Section 271 (1) and (4) of the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (as amended), His Excellency Babajide Sanwo-Olu, Governor of Lagos State, has appointed Honourable Justice Kazeem O.
