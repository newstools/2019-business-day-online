With the dearth of market catalysts to boost the Index back above the 30,000 point mark and into green territory, Vetiva Securities research analysts see the possibility of recording another session of negative trading on Tuesday. “We, however, do not rule out the possibility of bargain hunting on the depressed prices of stocks across the board,” the analysts said.
