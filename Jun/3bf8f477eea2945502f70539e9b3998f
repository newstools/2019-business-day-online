The Lagos State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Action Democratic Party (ADP) have called on the newly sworn-in governor of the state, Babajide Sanwo-Olu to serve the people of Lagos State with the fear of God and not that of man. In a separate message to journalists signed by the state chairmen, Segun Adewale and Adewale Bolaji, respectively, the parties urged Sanwo-Olu to immediately focus on delivering on his promises to the electorate in the state. The parties stated that the Sanwo-Olu administration should focus on advancing the state in all aspects, including job creation, empowerment of youth with entrepreneurship skills and improving the education standard in the state. However, the ADP tasked the governor to look critically at the alarming influx of Fulani herdsmen allegedly kidnapping people for ransom, which is creating panic amongst residents of the state. “First of all, Babajide Sanwo-Olu must prove to all Lagosians that he is a man of his own and not a puppet of any godfather as widely speculated. “The ADP is tasking Babajide Sanwo-Olu to critically look at the looming crisis which is silently brewing, the issue of influx of Fulani herdsmen, reportedly kidnapping people for ransom, which is creating panic amongst the residents of the state. “Security of lives and property must be another area topmost priority attention must be given, to give investors confidence of a conducive business environment in the state,” the ADP chairman said. The parties further urged Sanwo-Olu to address the duplicity in the collection of internally generated revenue of the state. “The issue of duplicity and multiple tax on Lagosians must be urgently reviewed, the Lagos public is not happy that a consultant (Alpha beta) is taking a chunk of between 10-30percent of monies they were contracted to collect as service charge; this collection software can be deployed to Lagos Internal Revenue Service (LIRS)”.
