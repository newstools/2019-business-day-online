Jimi Agbaje, governorship candidate of the main opposition the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), in Lagos State in the 2019 gubernatorial election, has described insinuations that he has defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) as false. Agaje stated this Thursday in a statement to journalists in Lagos. He said the statement was in reaction to Wednesday’s statement by PDP former National Vice Chairman, Bode George, that he had joined the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC). According to him, “People should please tell Bode George to shut up and leave PDP if he lacks any value to add to the party, instead of being a dog in the manger hampering the progress of the party in Lagos State.” The PDP chieftain, however, clarified the true position about him alleged cross-carpeting. The Pharmacist-turned-politician described the news about the purported defection as misinformation that should be discountenanced. Agbaje said he had never been a member of APC, stressing that any thought of returning to the APC had never cross his mind. “That false narrative is the product of a sick mind. Or how else do you describe someone who just sits down to concoct fiction and markets it as reality? He should tell the world where he got the news being spreading round,” Agbaje said. Agbaje however, berated George, pointing out that as long as the PDP National Headquarters continued to pamper the divisive characters and pander to their whims, the party would continue to fail elections in Lagos State. He calculated that George in the past clashed with former PDP chieftains who tried to contribute towards elevating the party but ended up frustrated. “These shameless party leaders have 2023 in mind. The game-plan is mischievously simple: Give the dog a bad name and chase it away from the party. “By 2023, this mudslinging will have scared off credible people from the party, which will leave the whole field to them to continue to corner party resources,” Agbaje added.
