Speaking on insecurity, Tinubu tasked government to address the issue of shortage of police personnel, by looking at the recruitment from 774 Local Governments and be able to effectively have information. “it takes time to train people; you equally create employment from such an action; I mean employment for the people and strengthen security intelligence from the grassroots
He said the government is making efforts to diversity the economy, adding “we have the various scale of thinking that the economic council will have to bring about” “ He noted that government was working on infrastructural deficit, poverty and insecurity. Those are the things that we will put emphasis on; you know it, I know it, there is infrastructural deficit across the country and without infrastructure, you cannot galvanise the economy; you have the question of electricity that is critical to industrialization and economic growth. “Sure, I don’t want to be clannish or sectional; the question is that we want to build a nation and always believe in our diversity for prosperity not from adversity and progressives like the president will join hands to build the country. “No matter what, we have nothing, but one country and that is the only way that we can stimulate growth and understanding among various nationalities; it is not by division” Tinubu who counseled against promoting religious conflicts and religious differences, noted that “nobody has control over where they were born; what they will be, how they will be raised and how their fate will affect their lives. “ So, we must remove that from our political setting, set it aside, build a nation and concentrate on trust and development.
