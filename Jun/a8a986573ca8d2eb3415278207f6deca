As reactions continue to trail the European Union Election Observation Mission (EU EOM) in Nigeria’s report on the 2019 general elections, Presidency has said it welcomed the report, promising to analyse it fully and act on the recommendations. A statement by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said “Presidency notes that the EU observers had been invited to the country by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and welcomed by the government of President Muhammadu Buhari. “This was a clear indication of the administration’s good intentions, commitment to a pure democratic process, and desire to improve for the next elections. According to the statement, “EU noted in their report that there were marked improvements from previous elections, although stating that more work needed to be done” Presidency assured that the administration of President Buhari will work with all Nigerian citizens, state institutions, parties, civil society, the media and other experts to make sure that the improvements recommended by the EU are implemented, and that these areas of concern are addressed. It is noteworthy that INEC is in receipt of a number of recommendations that form a part of the EU report. Presidency also assured that the Commission is in safe hands and happy that they are currently engaged in root and branch reviews of the 2019 general elections and will input lessons learned into its recommendations for electoral and constitutional reforms. “We believe that the commission conducted a good election and will continue to improve on its processes and procedures.” While it is regretted that the elections in a few parts of the country witnessed some violence, among other shortcomings highlighted by the EU, we note however that none of these hitches affected the overall outcome of the elections. While noting that “EU did not question the results of the presidential election”, Presidency said “ this is further proof that the polls reflected the overall will of Nigerians, and that the world is solidly behind the election of President Buhari for a second term.”
