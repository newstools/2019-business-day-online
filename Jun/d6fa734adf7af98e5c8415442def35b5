 The suspended  African Independent Television, AIT came back on air Friday night following earlier order by a Federal High Court in Abuja that Daar Communications Plc., owners of AIT and Raypower Radio should be re-opened. The National Broadcasting Commission, NBC Thursday revoked the operating license of Daar Commission for alleged failure of its media outfits to abide by the Commission’s directives as they have violated the provisions of the NBC Act Cap N11 Laws of the Federation of Nigeria and the Nigeria Broadcasting Code. Both AIT and Ray Power radio went off air after the NBC action but after the court order, the television station particularly was restored on DStv.

The plaintiff also prayed the court to restrain the defendants from invading or closing down the premises of Daar Communication, its operations or broadcast services, pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice filed along with this application. Alternatively, the plaintiff prayed for an order for maintenance of status quo ante bellum, as at May 30, 2019, pending the hearing and final determination of the Motion on Notice filed along with the ex-parte application. But the trial Judge, Justice Inyang Ekwo  in his ruling, after he had perused the affidavit in support of the ex-parte motion deposed to by one Kelly Elisha and heard from plaintiff counsel, Benson Igbanoi, held that, he woulf not grant prayers one and two of the plaintiff without hearing from other parties. “I have noted the eight grounds upon which the ex-parte application was hinged, application of this nature must be considered judicially and judiciously, that, I have done. “I hereby order that parties shall maintain status quo ante bellum as at May 30, 2019 pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice filed in this case”.
