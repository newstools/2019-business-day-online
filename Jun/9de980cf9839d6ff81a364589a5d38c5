Lagos state governor’s office has alerted members of the public to be weary of some people who may fraudulently use the office to commit criminal act. This security alert came to the fore, over the weekend after a middle-aged woman was arrested following an intelligence on the usage of the Governor’s office to seek visas for some members of the public. The suspect (name withheld), via an e-mail sent to the Embassy of Italy in Lagos allegedly posed as an official of Lagos State government and sought the country’s visas for some unsuspecting Nigerians. The embassy, however, wrote to the governor’s office to authenticate the claims, which were later found to be false. The letter from the Italian embassy led to further investigation and her subsequent arrest and interrogation. Although she denied the allegation claiming that her email was hacked, the Lagos State governor’s office has sent the matter to the appropriate security agencies for appropriate action. In the meantime, the office has warned members of the public not to deal with any persons who parade themselves as government representatives in consular matters.  Joshua Bassey
