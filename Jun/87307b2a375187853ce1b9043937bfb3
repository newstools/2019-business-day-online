The National Working Committee (NWC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has set up a fact-finding committee on the role played by some of its members at the election of the Presiding Officers of the Ninth National Assembly. The Committee which is chaired by former President of the Senate, Adolphus Wabara and ex-National Secretary of the PDP, Wale Oladipo, as Secretary, will find out why some of its lawmakers failed to abide by the decision of the party during the National Assembly leadership election on June 11. Although the party endorsed Ali Ndume and Umar Bago as candidates for Senate President and Speaker of the House of Representatives respectively, Ahmad Lawan and Femi Gbajabiamila defeated them to clinch the positions. A statement by Kola Ologbondiyan on Monday, listed other members of the committee to include: one-time Deputy President of the Senate, Ibrahim Mantu; Stella Omu, Austin Opara, Abdul Ningi, Margaret Icheen, among others. While the panel has three weeks to submit its report, other terms of reference include: to find out whether there is any involvement of the ruling Party in the decision taken by the members involved; find out and recommend ways to checkmate such tendencies in the future and ensure that, moving forward, all members work together to defend the interest of the party at all times and circumstances. “Where there are established reasons for taking the action by members, the committee should identify such so that the party can create mutual and political atmosphere for reasonable interaction with Senators and Honourable members,” the statement added.
