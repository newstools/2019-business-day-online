 According to Chike-Obi, “Most people who have generating set will be happier to pay N160 per kilowatt hour of electricity, but government said no. We can only charge Nigerians N60 per kilowatt-hour, yet nobody has it. Nobody is looking for it and nobody is interested in more investment into it to create more power.
“But if you allow these power companies to sell at N160 per kilowatt hour, they will make so much money from the rich people at the beginning, that they will start creating more power. Look at what happened with the telephone.
