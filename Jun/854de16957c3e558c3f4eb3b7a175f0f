 President Muhammadu Buhari has written the acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, Justice Muhammad Tanko to initiate action on the appointment of five new Justices of the Supreme Court. This is just as the President has also formerly confirmed the acceptance of the “voluntary retirement” of Justice Walter Onnoghen from service as the Chief Justice of Nigeria, CJN, effective from May 28, 2019. A statement signed by the Senior Special Assistant to the President on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, said the President wrote the letter, “Pursuant to the provisions of section 230(2) (A&B) of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria 1999 as amended. “I am pleased to request that you initiate in earnest the process of appointing additional five Justices of the Supreme Court of Nigeria to make the full complement of 21 Justices as provided for by the aforementioned provisions of the Constitution,” the president wrote. President Buhari declared that the action is in line with “Government’s agenda of repositioning the Judiciary in general and Supreme Court in particular for greater efficiency.” Buhari also said his government was concerned with “reducing the backlogs of appeal cases pending” at the apex Court. The statement said President Buhari “thanked Justice Onnoghen for his services to the Federal Republic of Nigeria and wished him the best of retirement life..” Tony Ailemen, Abuja
