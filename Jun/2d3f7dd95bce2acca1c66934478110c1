Her widely translated works include the award-winning novels “Purple Hibiscus”, “Half of a Yellow Sun” and “Americanah”, along with the book-length essay “We Should All Be Feminists”, which is based on her influential 2012 TED Talk of the same name.

Her most recent book is “Dear Ijeawele”, or a “Feminist Manifesto in Fifteen Suggestions”.  Modestus Anaesoronye
