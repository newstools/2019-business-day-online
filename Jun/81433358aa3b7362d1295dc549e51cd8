Chairman/CEO, Nigerians In Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has described the attitude of a 32-year old Nigerian, Jeffrey Apkovweta Ewohime who destroyed several properties of the Nigerian High Commission in London as “despicable and condemnable.” Dabiri-Erewa made this condemnation in a statement issued on Monday by her media aide, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, stressing that such an attitude was unpatriotic, and an unconscionable act of indiscipline. Dabiri-Erewa said she received a report that Emohime went to the Nigeria Higy Commission in London on Monday, The statement said that the young man had approached the Nigerian Mission to collect his passport which expired since Nov 2017 at about 2 p.m and was told collection of passports closes at 1pm. He then insisted on collecting his passport , and was told to bring his collection slip which he could not produce, the statement added. According to reports from the Mission it would of course be wrong to hand over his passport to him , without his collection slip, “He thereafter left agitated and returned from a nearby hotel to destroy about seven cars,5 belonging to the mission, and 2 to visitors who parked near by. “His attempt to destroy the High Commissioner’s car failed as it is a bullet proof. “I am told that he has been arrested by the police. ” “ This is a despicable act, which must be condemned by all. Of course, the law must take its course”, Abike said. Dabiri-Erewa therfore implored Nigerians abroad to exercise restraint and be good ambassadors of Nigeria at all times in all circumstances.
