Former Delta state Commissioner for Finance and APC Chieftain, Bernard Okumagba, has said that the new leadership of the senate will help  advance the progressive agenda of the ruling All Progressive Party (APC). Okumagba, who spoke to BusinessDay in a telephone chat, said the experience of the new team was needed at this time to support the president in implementing his Next Level development agenda for the nation. “With the election of this new leadership of the National Assembly, it is time for a new beginning to be focused on service to the Nigerian people, especially in the areas of employment, security, and national cohesion,” Okumagba said. The former Delta commissioner also congratulated Senator Ovie Omo-Agege for his victory as the Deputy Senate President saying that his victory was a well-deserved one. He commended the leadership qualities of Senator Omo-Agege and his acceptance across a broad spectrum of the senators which ensured his overwhelming victory in the contest for the office of Deputy President of the Senate. “Senator Omo-Agege’s pedigree as a forthright person, a dependable and loyal party-man, fighter for justice, equity and progress is reassuring. While wishing the new Deputy Senate President well, Okumagba “prayed God to grant him good health, strength and wisdom in his new responsibility.” The APC chieftain also congratulated the President of the Senate, Senator Ahmed Lawan, and other elected leaders of the Ninth National Assembly.
