The Sustainable Entrepreneurship and Economic Development Initiative (SEEDi) has called on President Muhammadu Buhari to without delay, begin the process of constituting his cabinet ahead of the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly. According to them, the Nigerian economy is faced with a myriad of challenges that have continued to increase the misery and suffering of a large number of Nigerians. This, the group says, makes it mandatory for the President to quickly nominate ministers and other key members to keep the economy running without any form of delay. “We call on President Buhari to include portfolios for each nominees that will be sent to the National Assembly and as such, the culture of sending in nominations to the National Assembly without attaching the offices for which the ministerial nominees are being considered for does not reflect the seriousness ministerial nominations should be given,” Celestine Okeke, lead partner, SEEDi said in a statement made available to BusinessDay. “We urge the President to publish the list of those being considered for ministerial nominations with a view to allowing for opinions, feedback and appraisal by key stakeholders while waiting for the inauguration of the 9th National Assembly,” Okeke said. He appreciated the fact that ministerial nomination is a prerogative of the President, while calling on him to ensure he delivers on the Next Level agenda.  Josephine Okojie
