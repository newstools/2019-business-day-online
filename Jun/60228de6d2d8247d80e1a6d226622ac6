President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday commiserated with families of victims of bomb blasts at a viewing centre in Mandarari, Konduga Local Government Area of Borno State, where scores were killed on Sunday. The President while sending condolences to the government and people of the state over attacks by suicide bombers, decried the heinous acts, stressing that perpetrators of evil acts had judgment awaiting them, not only from man, via the long arms of the law, but also from God Almighty. In a statement by the Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, the President directed security agents to sustain surveillance in all theatres of security challenges in the country, taking into consideration the unconventional methods deployed by terrorists to harm innocent and unsuspecting victims. The President commended the efforts of emergency response workers and humanitarian organizations. He prayed that God will grant the souls of the departed eternal rest and comfort their families, the statement said. These attacks targeted at soft spots are coming on the heels of the several successes recorded by the joint security task force, whose activities had led to the degrading of the Boko Haram insurgents in the North East.
