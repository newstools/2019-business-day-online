The Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) said it is aware of various speculative reports which stated that the postponed Airtel Africa listing on NSE is scheduled for Monday, July 8, 2019. Rather, the NSE on Sunday said the official date for the listing is Tuesday, July 9th, 2019. The shares of the Telco would have been listed on the Exchange last week but it didn’t happen because SEC didn’t approve it.  Iheanyi Nwachukwu
