He said “we are pleased to have hosted a very successful 6th edition of the NSE Corporate Challenge which recorded over 800 people in attendance. In addition to the total proceeds from previous editions, the Exchange has committed to donate a sum of N20 million to scale up impact in screening and early detection of cancer. These funds will be channelled for the implementation of specific cancer-focused projects in partnership with technical partners”. “Since the launch of the NSE’S cancer awareness and fundraising campaign in 2014, a total sum of N63 million has been raised through sponsorship and participation. We are pleased that NSE Corporate Challenge has grown into a signature cancer advocacy and fundraising event that many institutions are fast associating with to contribute their quota in raising awareness and funds to fight cancer”, added Onyema The donation by NSE will be used to bolster ongoing efforts by NSE’S technical partners to improve access to cancer supportive services and increase access for those in underserved communities to qualitative cancer consultation regardless of their level of health insurance or ability to pay.
