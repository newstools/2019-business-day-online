The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has revised Nigeriaâ€™s 2019 economic growth projection marginally by 0.3 percent to 2.3 percent while projecting a 2.6 percent growth in 2020. Recall that in June 2019, the IMF trimmed initially forecast growth of 2.2 percent for the Nigerian economy to 2.0 percent on the back of slower-than-expected mining, oil production and domestic policy uncertainties. The IMF also recently pared its forecast for global economic growth again by 0.1 percent to a projected growth of 3.2 percent in 2019, on the back of trade wars, Brexit worries and muted inflation.
