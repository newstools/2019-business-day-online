An online verification platform that enables landlords and property managers to vet prospective tenants, check property location, data and rental history, debuts in Nigeria.
Known as ‘Vetenant,’ the revolutionary electronic landlord-tenant-property devise management and accountability system, aims to curtail the monster of delinquent tenants, build confidence in investors and bridge the gap between supply and demand in the housing value chain.
In a statement issued in Abuja, Buconpro Technology Limited, the promoter of Vetenant, says the platform is a “unique one-stop solution for Landlords, Tenants property owners, managers and housing Professionals.” Vetenant is a real-time, online verification platform for landlords, tenants, property managers to vet prospective tenants, check property location, data and rental history with instant feedback, the statement notes.
According to Buconpro, Vetenant aims to increase Nigeria’s overall housing stock and helps to track each current, past, delinquent, evicted, violent or non-paying tenant on any private or commercial property. The statement notes Vetenant “helps build greater investor confidence in the Nigerian housing sector.”
