Digifypro Nigeria, a not-forprofit initiative facilitated by Digify Africa (a digital skills academy based in South Africa) and supported by Facebook, has called on media agencies and corporate organizations to take up the opportunity in its effort to create the next generation of digital talents. According to Program Director of Digifypro NG, Florence Olumodimu this will not only help reduced the level of unemployment among talented journalist but also provide participating companies a hungry set of well-trained young talents ready to make an impact. “Since its launch in 2014, Digifypro has gone from strength to strength and won a number of awards along the way. We organised a 8-week intensive digital marketing bootcamp, which started in Johannesburg over five years ago has impacted many young people by kick-starting over 200 careers in the digital world, with critical skills needed within the digital economy,” she said. She noted that Feedback from the participants of Digifypro Cohort 1.0 and a Cohort 2.0 has been positive and is proof that this initiative is a much-needed one for young graduates, the industry and Nigeria as a whole. “In the intensive 8-week bootcamp supported by Facebook, trainees learn about the full spectrum of digital marketing from SEO to content marketing. They are also given exposure to the industry with weekly live briefs set by agencies, where trainees are able to conceptualise campaigns and show off their talents to prospective employers. Most importantly, in the 8 weeks they are given job readiness skills to ensure that they are able to thrive in the workplace and offer value to their employers.” Explaining further she said, “Past participants of Digifypro NG have had the priviledge of working at some of the biggest agencies in Nigeria such as Fuel Communications, Leo Burnett Lagos, Digitxplus, Iprospect, Nitro121, Isobar, Business School Netherlands Nigeria, X3M Ideas, Teras Doxas, Webcoupers, QVT Media, Brandeye Media, Etu-odi Communications, Isobar, AMNET, DKT Nigeria, Bluebird Communications, to mention a few.
