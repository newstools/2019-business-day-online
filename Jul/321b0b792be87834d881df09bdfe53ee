Hon. Femi Gbajabiamila; the Executive Governor of Lagos State, Mr. Babatunde Sanwo-Olu; the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr. Godwin Emefiele and; Captain Hosea Wells Okunbor, a staunch financier and supporter of the Super Eagles. “These distinguished personalities not showed up at the Alexandria Stadium; they oozed passion and love for the game of football and for our dear nation.
