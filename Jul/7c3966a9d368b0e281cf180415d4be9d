 The Nigerian Senate has denounced the invasion on Tuesday of the National Assembly by members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, otherwise known as the Shiites, during which they shot security men and vandalised facilities at the Complex.
The attack, over the continued detention of their leader, Ibrahim El-Zakzakky, was a desecration of the hallowed National Legislative Institute of Nigeria, Senator Adedayo Adeyeye, chairman, Senate ad hoc Committee on Media and Public Affairs, said Wednesday.  He said this while addressing journalists on the invasion.
The Senate spokesman lamented that members of the Sect forced their way into the National Assembly Complex, and overpowered the security network, and even seized the gun of one of the security men on duty.
Describing the attack as an  “unwarranted affront on the Federal Parliament,” Adeyeye note that the attackers burnt three vehicles belonging to individuals, with many other cars vandalised, adding that the invasion forced the House of Representatives to adjourn plenary.
While the Inspector-General of Police had ordered an investigation into the attack, Adeyeye noted that the entire law enforcement apparatus in the country must be involved in the search.
To forestall a repeat of the incidence, he called for increased security around the National Assembly Complex.
“Senate hereby calls for security beef-up within the National Assembly and other institutions henceforth.”
