Tunisia progressed to their first Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) semi-final in 15 years after beating debutants and tournament surprise package Madagascar 3-0 in the quarter finals at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo on Thursday night. Second half goals from Ferjani Sassi, skipper Youssef Msakni and substitute Naim Slitti saw the Carthage Eagles effectively end the Indian Ocean island country’s fairytale run at the Total AFCON Egypt 2019 and qualify for the last four for the first time since 2004 when they won the title. Tunisia will face off with Senegal in Sunday’s semi-final at the June 30 Stadium in Cairo. For the first time in this tournament, Madagascar looked really uncomfortable and were forced to passing mistakes by the high pressing Tunisians who seemed to have done their homework on the debutants. Whenever Madagascar had the ball, Tunisia pressed high, shutting spaces between them and making it difficult for them to play their usual passing game.
