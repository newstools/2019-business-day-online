Telecommunications giant MTN Group has established its own wholesale infrastructure company called GlobalConnect; an operating company (Opco) within the parent group.
The move follows a review of the operational structure of the Dubai-headquartered GlobalConnect to further enable growth which is in line with the group’s strategic focus on wholesale. Explaining further on the new move, Jens Schulte-Bockum, MTN Group Chief Operating Officer said, “I am pleased that after less than two years of operation, MTN GlobalConnect has exceeded expectations, growing its customer base and revenue ahead of targets”.
The Opco was established in 2017 as a commercial vehicle for the consolidation of MTN’s international and national major wholesale activities while Frédéric Schepens, the current chief executive will continue to lead the Opco. Schulte-Bockum expressed optimism about the team led by Frédéric noting that he will continue to build on their gains to drive value to the group’s operations, and lead MTN’s ambition to build Africa’s leading wholesale company. “Offering the most complete backbone network in Africa, the company provides reliable solutions for fixed connectivity and international mobile services and is the single entry point to the largest network infrastructure on the continent”. The COO stated. GlobalConnect strives to enable services that create significant value for other MTN Opcos, partners and third parties looking to gain from the growing opportunities in the Middle East and Africa.
