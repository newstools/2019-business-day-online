The World Federation of Exchanges (WFE), the global industry group for exchanges and central counterparty clearing house (CCPs) on Tuesday July 30 responded to the International Organisation of Securities Commissions’ (IOSCO) Consultation Report on Issues, Risks and Regulatory Considerations Relating to Crypto-Asset Trading Platforms. The consultation report highlights the current issues and risks that have been identified with the trading of crypto-assets on trading platforms (CTPs) such as transparency of operations, price discovery mechanisms, clearing and settlement, safekeeping of participants’ assets, identification and management of conflicts of interests. It also identifies the fragmented approach across regulatory jurisdictions in the regulation of CTPs, due to differences between the emerging sets of rules that are being proposed and implemented by individual national authorities. The WFE supports IOSCO’s proposals to highlight the key considerations that national regulators should consider, and to provide toolkits that they could use when regulating CTPs. In its response, the WFE recommends the establishment of a co-ordinated, widely understood and applied approach to the regulation of CTPs, under the guidance of IOSCO’s Objectives and Principles of Securities Regulation (IOSCO Principles) and hopes that international standard setters will continue to work together to produce a unified, global approach to the regulation of CTPs. This approach will likely benefit national regulators, consumers and the industry alike, as much needed certainty and clarity is introduced to the marketplace.
