Babatunde Onakoya, an All Progressives Congress (APC) Chieftain in Ogun East Senatorial District has declared that the choice of Olamilekan Adegbite as the ministerial nominee from Ogun state was arrived at by the Presidency based on the achievements he recorded in the state in the area of roads construction and infrastructural development. It will be recalled that former Governor Ibikunle Amosun and Governor Dapo Abiodun of Ogun state had engaged in a fierce battle prior to 2019 Governorship Election in the state which prompted the floating of a new political party – Allied People’s Movement (APM) by Amosun which broke away from APC to field his political godson – Adekunle Akinlade against the incumbent Governor Dapo Abiodun. Against the backdrop of political football that played out during and after the 2019 Governorship Election in the state, it was believed that former Governor Amosun who is now Senator representing Ogun Central Senatorial District might not get the ministerial slot going by the norms that incumbent recommends ministerial nominee for the Presidency, but the ex governor did and got the slot for one of his followers – Adegbite. But, speaking with BDSUNDAY on Friday in Abeokuta, Onakoya, who is a Patron of APC Fans’ Club in Ogun state, noted that despite a stiff opposition put up by some disgruntled elements within the party against the choice of Adegbite as Ogun ministerial nominee, President Buhari still went ahead to include Adegbite’s name to the 43 names of ministerial nominees submitted before the Senate on Tuesday for confirmation. A Board Member of Benin-Owena River Basin Development Authority explained that the president had earlier said that he would consider merit as against the political considerations in appointing the members of Federal Executive Council, saying the president only demonstrated the sincerity of purpose he is known for. He said, “As you know, Architect Lekan Adegbite has really done well in the area of roads, overhead bridges construction and other critical infrastructures in the last eight years as the Commissioner for Works and Infrastructure in Ogun state. “A trip around Ogun state, especially in the Ogun central where state capital is located testifies to my claim that Lekan Adegbite did well. “I commend President Muhammadu Buhari for considering merits ahead of politics in choosing Adegbite whom we believe will replicate the wonders he did perform in Ogun state at the federal level if he were given a Minister of Works’ slot. “We believe that critical infrastructures in this country need urgent and holistic approach and upgrade and Adegbite is cut out for it, his appointment in Works Ministry will change many things.
