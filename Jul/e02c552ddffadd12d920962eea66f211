The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has debunked reports of crisis rocking the party over appointment of Principal Officers of the 9th National Assembly. There were reports of face-off among Members of the National Working Committee, NWC of APC over who emerged Majority Leader of the House of Representatives ahead of the Tuesday resumption date of the House. According to the report, there is crisis brewing in the APC leadership as Adams Oshiomhole, the party’s National Chairman is perfecting plans to impose Aminu Sulaiman (APC, Kano) as the Majority Leader of the House of Representatives against the wishes of other NWC Members who are supporting Ado Doguwa (APC, Kano) for the same position. But Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary in a statement made available to journalists Sunday night said the report is false and should be disregarded. Issa-Onilu stated that consultations are ongoing and in APC typical style, the party will come out to formally announce the its decision on the appointments. He noted that, in arriving at party decisions and in all its activities, APC has always been transparent, ensuring the best democratic principles are adhered to in whatever steps the party takes. “Our attention has been drawn to a report in circulation purporting the appointment of the remaining principal officers of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 9th National Assembly. “With the prevalence of fake news, we urge the media to always wait for and rely on official statements from the party other than unofficial sources. The media should please take due note of this on future issues that involve our party”, Issa-Onilu warned.  James Kwen, Abuja
