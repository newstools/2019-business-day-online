Seven months after it swung into action, the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialisation Programme (NGFCP), under the Nigerian Ministry of Petroleum Resources, now has a list of successful candidates who have qualified to participate in a bidding round to secure flared gas for monetisation. Folasade Yemi-Esan, permanent secretary at the ministry on Thursday, said an initial evaluation exercise covering some 238 Statements of Qualification was complete. Yemi-Esan added that 205 applicants would be emailed this week with invitations to attend a Qualified Applicants’ Workshop 19th August at the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) in Abuja ahead of the Requests for Proposals (RfP) phase, according to a report from www.upstreamonline.com, a platform that provides oil and gas news.
