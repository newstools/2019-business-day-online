President Muhammadu Buhari has requested the Senate to confirm the appointment of the Acting Chief Justice of Nigeria, Tanko Muhammad as substantive CJN. The President’s request comes a day after the National Judicial Council (NJC) recommended the Acting CJN to President Buhari as the substantive head of the nation’s judiciary. In a letter to President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, the President also forwarded the names of 15 individuals for confirmation as Special Advisers. The request for Muhammad’s confirmation is expected to be slated in the Order Paper for the next legislative sitting next week after which it would be referred to Committee of the Whole for screening. Justice Muhammad was sworn in as the Acting CJN on January 25, immediately after the then CJN, Justice Walter Onnoghen, was suspended by Buhari. The President in April requested and obtained the NJC’s consent to extend Muhammad’s acting tenure by the constitutionally allowed three months.  The extended three months period is  due to lapse on July 25, 2019.
