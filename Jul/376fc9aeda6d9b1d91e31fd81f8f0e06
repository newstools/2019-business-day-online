The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has acknowledged the Situation Room report on the 2019 general elections, following the completion of an internal review. The report yet to be officially shared was released on Tuesday, according to a statement signed by Rotimi Oyekanmi, chief press secretary to the INEC chairman. The Commission pledged to study the report released by all national and international observers accredited for the polls and work on the recommendations with a view to strengthening democracy in Nigeria. “The Commission is concious of its responsibilities and expectations of all Nigerians and is determined to ensure that free, fair and credible elections are conducted at all times,” the statement said. The results of the 2019 elections announced by INEC gave President Muhammadu Buhari a renewed mandate to rule for another four-year term. However, controversies around transparency and precision, among other issues, continue to generate reactions on the credibility of the election.  Temitayo Ayetoto
