SchoolMe Scholarship Lottery on Monday gave out scholarship to the tune of N1.3 million to six persons who were having difficulties in financing their education.
Speaking during the cheque presentation to winners of its maiden scholarship draw on Monday in Abuja, Karrim Olusegun, general manager SchoolMe Lottery, noted that the social intervention programme was aimed at addressing the issues of inadequate, qualitative and responsive education in the country. He expressed further concern that the high deficit in the education sector was responsible for the increasing rate of youths embracing social vices and being used as tools by politicians to perpetrate violence in order to disrupt what he described as the “whole essence of our living as individuals and as Nigerians.” According to Olusegun, the organisation has used the programme to rescue many youths from the streets, and helped students having financial troubles to concentrate more on their studies.
“Majority of those who have been in this programme with us has won on several occasions and have been able to stay put in school and see their dreams come to passes.
“Education must be given to as many that desire to have it. It shouldn’t be just for the rich, high and mighty but for as many that desires it,” he said. Head of Operations of the organisation, Nsikan Ekaette, noted that SchoolMe had assisted many students in tertiary institutions in their educational pursuits, and also helped candidates to register for Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examinations (UTME).
“On 28th June, our maiden scholarship draw was held live on WAZOBIA FM Abuja under the supervision of auditors from the National Lottery Regulatory Commission. Four winners won N100,000 project money, one winner each grabbed N200,000 and N700,000 public and private school fee, respectively,” he said.
