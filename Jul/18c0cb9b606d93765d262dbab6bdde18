Nigeria’s Super Eagles took the lead through Villarreal striker Samuel Chukwueze as he controlled Alex Iwobi’s cross to net his first goal for Nigeria. William Troost-Ekong sealed the victory when he scored a dramatic late winner to send Nigeria into the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) semi-final against the Bafana Bafana of  South Africa. Bongani Zungu equalised with a header initially ruled out for offside before VAR replays showed a free-kick hit a Nigerian player on the way to him. Nigeria face either Ivory Coast or Algeria in Sunday’s second semi-final (20:00 BST). The Super Eagles were deserved winners and led through Villarreal youngster Chukwueze’s first goal for his country. They should have been ahead by more when Williams pushed Peter Etebo’s free-kick onto the bar. Zungu’s goal was the first in the Africa Cup of Nations given by the VAR, which has just been introduced for the quarter-finals. It looked offside initially but Percy Tau’s free-kick hit Nigeria’s Odion Ighalo on the way on to Amiens midfielder Zungu’s head. The game looked set for extra time before Williams flapped at a cross to leave Troost-Ekong with a simple finish. Senegal, who beat Benin 1-0 earlier on Wednesday, play either Madagascar or Tunisia in the other semi-final. Nigeria are the second side in the semi-final after Senegal beat Benin earlier in the day.  Anthony Nlebem
