Ifeanyi Ochonogor, president, e-waste Relief Foundation (ERF) has urged the Federal Government to license companies exporting used electronics, as a way out of checking the high volume of electronic waste that constitute environmental challenges in Nigeria. He advocated for more cautious handling of electronic waste (e-waste) to avoid environmental and health challenges and ecological degradations. Ochonogor, who is also the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of E-Terra Technologies Ltd, stated this in a recent presentation at the inaugural stakeholders’ meeting of players in the e-waste industry themed ‘Circular Economy Approaches to the Electronic Sector’ held in Lagos. The expert, however, stressed the need for proper enlightenment and education of the citizenry on the dangers of e-waste and need for proper handling and disposal through the combined efforts of government and industry stakeholders. According to him, “As our lives and businesses continually transform with technology, so also does the associated challenges occasioned by the improper disposal of these devices at their end of life or obsolete period. “Certification of companies importing these electronics is important to ensure they meet international best practices, electronic wastes (e-waste) are not properly handled by trained personnel with efficient machinery, capable of containing its numerous components, which results in severe environmental hazards such as air pollution, ground water contamination, food pollution and ecological degradations,” Ochonogor said. Speaking further, Ochonogor, said research had showed that rising cases of diseases like cancer, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases were caused by undue exposure to radioactive substances resulting from improper disposal of e-waste. “Research have showed that the rising cases of diseases like cancer, diabetes and other cardiovascular diseases are caused by undue exposure to radioactive substances resulting from improper disposal of e-waste,” he added.
