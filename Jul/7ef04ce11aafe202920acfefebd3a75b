At least 68 traders were affected by a fire outbreak at Amaigbo Market in Obiagu, a sprawling suburb in Enugu, on Friday. The fire destroyed goods worth millions of naira. NAN reports that Emeka Nnajiofor, chairman of the market, disclosed this to Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, who paid a condolence visit to the traders, saying the fire broke out around 1:00 am and that the cause of the fire was yet to be ascertained. Nnajiofor said that most of the stalls in the market were completely razed down by the fire. Nkechi Eneh, executive secretary, Enugu State Emergency Management Agency, said that they got a distress call about the inferno and alerted the state Fire Service which, she said, responded promptly. Eneh said that it took the men of the fire service about two hours to put out the fire. “The fire affected 68 traders and they are all gathered here,” Eneh told the governor. Responding, Ugwuanyi directed the chairman of Enugu North council area to take an inventory of the losses caused by the fire. He also asked the chairman to ascertain the cost of reconstructing the market and forward the same to his office. He promised to support the victims with N100,000 each to enable them to return to their businesses. “We are here to help and console you. The chairman of the council has been directed to evaluate the cost of rebuilding the stalls and report back to us,” Ugwuanyi said.
