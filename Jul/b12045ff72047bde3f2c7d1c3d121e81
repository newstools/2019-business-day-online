Sarsoli Industrial Company Ltd was recently presented with PECB Canada ISO 9001:2015 Certificate for successfully completing and complying with the requirements of ISO 9001:2015 Standards and hopes it will use the latest feat to further its industrial growth. The milestone certificate presentation ceremony was well appreciated by the management and staff of the organisation according to company sources could not have come at an auspicious time like this when many manufacturing companies are facing numerous challenges, leading to permanent closure of some of the worst heat in the face of harsh operating environment. According to the general manager of Sarsoli Industrial Company Ltd, Baskaran Thiyagarajan,”the implementation of the ISO 9001 standard was rigorous but has helped us to design our system such that nobody is found wanting with respect to their tasks. We have been able to integrate the requirements of the standards into our system which has improved our efficiency and output lately.” Also giving more insight into the nitty-gritty and processes that culminated into Sarsoli getting the award, John Aderibigbe, managing consultant of DU&T Consulting while presenting the certificate to the general manager, emphasized that the certificate is not an award for keeps. He rather described it as a symbol that the company’s system is compliant with the requirements of the ISO 9001:2015 and Sarsoli expected to maintain the certificate by reviewing their processes, getting customers feedback and analyzing it; conducting internal audit and management review as well as taking continuous corrective actions. By implementing the ISO 9001:2015 standards, it can help organizations improve the way it responses to both an internal and external environments and bridges the gap between the organizational existing processes and international best practices. Experiences have shown that no organization implements any of these international standards without experiencing positive change in terms of improvement in their processes, strategies, customer satisfaction, and reduction in errors as well as an increase in corporate profitability.
