Manchester City forward Riyad Mahrez scored a 95th minute free-kick to defeat Nigeria and send Algeria to the  Africa Cup of Nation (AFCON) final. Super Eagles defender William Troost-Ekong own goal had given Algeria the lead before Odion Ighalo’s penalty levelled the scores. Algeria will now face Senegal, who earlier defeated Tunisia thanks to an extra-time own goal, in the final on Friday.
