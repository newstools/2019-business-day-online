The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has summoned the minority leadership of the House of Representatives announced by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila. This comes as the PDP Board of Trustees has thrown its weight behind the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) on the rejection of the minority leadership announced by the Speaker. A statement by the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbondiyan, said the summon was in line with the provisions of Chapter 10 (57)(3) of its Constitution. In summoning the lawmakers, the party said the decision was arrived at after a crucial meeting of the NWC in Abuja on Thursday, insisting that Kingsley Chinda remained its preferred candidate as Minority Leader. Those summoned include: Ndudi Elumelu, Wole Oke, Lynda Ikpeazu, Anayo Edwin, Gideon Gwadi, Toby Okechukwu and Adekoya Abdul-Majid. Also, addressing a press conference in Abuja, Chairman of the party’s Board of Trustees, Walid Jibrin, expressed support for the party’s action and asked the Speaker to announce the names of members sent to him as minority leaders.
