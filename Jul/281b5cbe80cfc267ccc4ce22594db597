The Senate has commenced the screening of ministerial nominees with four nominees already screened so far. BusinessDay reports that while nominees who are former lawmakers were asked to take a bow and go in line with its parliamentary tradition, others who are not legislators were grilled for a long time. As of the time of filing this report, those that have been screened include Uchechukwu Ogah (Abia), Godswill Akpabio (Akwa Ibom), George Akume (Benue) and Emeka Nwajuaba (Imo). Save for Ogah, the three other nominees were asked to take a bow, being former or serving lawmakers. While Akpabio and Akume were senators in the Eighth Senate, Nwajuaba is currently a member of the House of Representatives. Details laterâ€¦.  OWEDE AGBAJILEKE, Abuja
