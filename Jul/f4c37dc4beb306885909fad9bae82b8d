The PDP Governors Forum (PDPGF) has applauded Monday judgement of the Supreme Court which rejected the application by the All Progressives Congress (APC), seeking a review of the apex court judgement of May 24 on the Zamfara Governorship Election. In a press statement issued from its Abuja Secretariat, the Chairman of the Forum, Seriake Dickson and Governor of Bayelsa State, threw its weight behind the five-man panel of justices, led by Justice Bode Rhodes-Vivour, that unanimously ruled that the application was incompetent and lacking in merit. The Forum applauded the apex court for affirming its earlier decision over the matter. “Providence has by this verdict, put a stamp of approval on the exceptional developments achieved in the state by Governor Bello Matawalle since being sworn in on May 29, 2019. “God stopped their sinister plan to thwart the people-oriented human, social, economic, environmental and structural development blueprints that Matawalle and his team have already rolled out for the state. “We, in the PDP and majority of the good people of Zamfara, will welcome any errant but repentant APC politician, who sheds negativity and joins hands with us to implement policies that will further this State. “May the good Lord give Governor Bello Matawalle the wisdom, strength and foresight to expand the developmental territories of Zamfara to a height that the entire people of the state will be proud of,” the statement reads. Recall that Robert Clarke (SAN), lead counsel for the APC, had filed an application for the Supreme Court to review its previous judgement. The panel in its Monday judgement said the application should not have been brought before it in the first place. The Supreme Court had on May 24 nullified the votes cast for APC in the governorship, National Assembly and state Assembly elections in Zamfara State for its inability to successfully conduct party primaries.
