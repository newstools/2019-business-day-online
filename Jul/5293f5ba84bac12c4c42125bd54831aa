Barring any unforeseen circumstances, Access Bank Nigeria Plc, is set to continue its tradition of rewarding shareholders at half year, a notice sent by the company to the Nigerian Stock Exchange last week indicated. The Nigerian lender indicated that its board of directors would meet on Friday July 26, 2019 to consider and approve its audited interim financial statement for the year ended June 30, 2019. “The audited accounts will be submitted to the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) for approval before release on the floor of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). The company has also declared a close period in respect of transaction on its securities from July 6, 2019 to such a date as will be subsequently announced (both days inclusive) in compliance with the listing rules of the NSE”, a statement authorised by Sunday Ekwochi, company’s secretary, stated. “The payment of interim dividend may also be considered at the meeting”, Ekwochi added.
Traditionally, Access Bank has consistently paid interim dividend to shareholders about August of the financial year. In 2015, it announced N0.25 per share interim dividend on August 20, 2015 with September 3 and 10 of that year as closure and payment dates respectively. It also announced N0.25 interim dividend on August 19, 2016 with September 6 and 13 as closure and payment dates respectively.

Similarly, on August 28, 2018, Access Bank proposed N0.25 interim dividend to shareholders with September 11 and 21 as payment dates respectively. With 35.5 billion shares outstanding, and should Access Bank maintain its tradition of paying N0.25 as interim dividend, total dividend payout will be in the region of N8.88 billion. And at 20.41 percent dividend payout ratio, total comprehensive income might hit N44 billion at half year 2019.
