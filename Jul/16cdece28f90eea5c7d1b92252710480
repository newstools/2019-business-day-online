Chairman, Christian Council of Nigeria, SouthSouth Zone, Tunde Adeleye says the suspension of the controversial RUGA settlement project still leaves to be desired, noting that what Nigerians want is outright cancellation of the project. Adeleye, who is also the archbishop of Ecclesiastical Province of Niger-delta (Anglican Communion), made the assertion on Monday while briefing newsmen on the 2019 Synod at the Cathedral Church of The Holy Trinity, Anglican Communion, Calabar, the Cross River State capital. “The suspension of controversial RUGA settlement project is a welcome development. But it is still dangerous and scary because the Arewa Youths have given the Federal Government an ultimatum to restore it. The president of Ohanaze has just ordered the Igbo’s to be prepared to defend themselves. The Yoruba leaders have insisted that such a thing will never be allowed to be executed in the Southwest. These show that peace has not yet come. “We are now sure of the details of National Livestock Transformation Plan ( NLTP) regarding the movement of cows in the country .Nigeria is a multi-religious country, and no religion should be a state religion. Christians will need to wake up and fight against this through prayers.” The archbishop lamented that Nigeria is now divided along religious lines even as there is attempt to promote one tribe above others. “This explains why herdsmen are able to freely kill and maim people without inhibition and the Federal Government seems helpless in the matter.” Adeleye restated the position expressed by other Nigerians that the RUGA project is not in tandem with the constitution because, according to it, land is kept in trust with the state government. “So it totally negates our laws and it is dangerous because there is no way you can juxtapose it with our culture and tradition as a people,” he said.
