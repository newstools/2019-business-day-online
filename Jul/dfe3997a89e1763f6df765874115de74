The first production line of the rice mill being constructed by the government of Lagos State, at Imota in Ikorodu, will commence by the end of 2019. The state governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, made this known while briefing journalists after undertaking an inspection tour of the site, which also comprises an industrial estate. The rice mill is coming with 38 metric tonnes capacity per hour, making it the largest rice mill in Nigeria, when completed. It is expected to throw up 1000 to 1,500 job opportunities and positively impact the rice value chain, as Sanwo-Olu says Lagos is in discussion with the neighbouring states and rice farmers to supply paddy to the mill. The construction of the mill started over 12 months ago, under the former administration of Akinwunmi Ambode, and it is being handled by Ciba Construction Limited. Ademola Amure, managing director of Ciba Construction, who corroborates the governor, says construction works at the mill and adjoining industrial park are over 60 percent complete, and willÂ  hopefully wrap up by end of this year.
