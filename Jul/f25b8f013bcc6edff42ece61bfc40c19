As stock market continues to exhibit softness, analysts believe there is still no major catalyst to drive the market into the positive territory. “We have consistently highlighted the attractiveness of the prices of some of the counters and we believe at the new lows we saw today (Tuesday), investors can begin to cherry pick while they stagger their purchase,” said Lagos-based Vetiva research in their July 2 equity market note to investors. In the absence of any positive news, the analysts expect the market to trade in a similar pattern in Wednesday’s session.
