President Muhammadu Buhari has described Wole Soyinka, Nigeria’s first ever Nobel Laureate as one of the country’s greatest prides and a universal brand. Buhari made the statement through his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, in Abuja on Friday while commemorating the 85th birthday of the literary icon. According to him, the lifestyle of Soyinka is a clear message to Nigerians and Africans, especially the younger generation, that real success is measured by the intangibles of courage and impact brought to others, rather than the pursuit of personal interests.
