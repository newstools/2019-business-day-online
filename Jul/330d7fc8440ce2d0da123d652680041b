Algeria reached the semi-finals of the Africa Cup of Nations by beating Ivory Coast 4-3 on penalties following a 1-1 draw after extra time. Algeria will play Nigeria for a place at the final on Sunday in Cairo. The encounter ended one-all after 120 minutes with Turkey-based Sofiane Feghouli scoring in the first half for Les Fennecs whilst Jonathan Kodjia levelled in the second half. The North Africans had the luxury of missing a penalty early in the second half when Baghdad Bounedjah shot at the cross-bar, but had the last laugh on penalties. During penalties, Rami Bensebaini, Islam Slimani, Andy Delort and Adam Ounas scored for Algeria whilst Franck Kessie, Maxwell Cornet and Max Gradel converted for the West Africans. Striker Wilfried Bony and Serey Die missed their spots kicks with Youcef Belaili also failing to score from the shot distance. It was yet again another painful exit for Les Elephants who have failed to make an impression since winning their second AFCON title in 2015 in Equatorial Guinea. The Ivorians, champions also in 1992, failed to go past the group stage in 2017 in Gabon.
