Barely eight hours after a high powered security meeting between Taraba and the Benue state government held in Makurdi, Gese village, a Tiv community in Wukari local government area of Taraba was attacked and razed by suspected Jukun youths. This is even as one person was said to be missing between Tar-Orshi and New area on his way to Wukari. Nathaniel Gbanwuan, a resident of the community told our correspondent that the attackers invaded the village at about 2:am on Sunday and burnt the entire village. Gbanwuan noted that no life was lost in the attack as the villagers have since fled the community located along Rafinkada -Donga road for fear of attack which subsequently happened. Caretaker Chairman of Wukari Local Government Council, Daniel Adi in a telephone interview with our correspondent said a Jukun man travelling on a motorcycle from Rafinkada to Wukari was reportedly missing on Sunday morning. Adi who confirmed the attack on Gese village, however said the attack was carried out by irate Tiv youths who were prevailed upon by some Tiv elders not to attack Rafinkada. Our correspondent reports that the Tor-Tiv, Prof. James Ayatse had during the security meeting insisted that for genuine peace to return in Wukari, the indigenous Tiv people in the area must be accommodated and integrated. “The Jukun and the Tiv people have a common history in the Benue valley and any body who now want to expel the Tiv people from Wukari for whatever reason must think twice, because the agenda will not work. “The crisis in Wukari will only stop when the Tiv people in Wukari are accepted as indigines of Taraba,” he said. The Tiv paramount Ruler who backed the call to end the killings, called for the sincerity of purpose on the part of government and the people in ending the hostilities. Taraba State Police Public Relations Officer, DSP. David Missal told our correspondent that he was yet to receive briefing on the two incidents.  Nathaniel Gbaoron, Jalingo
