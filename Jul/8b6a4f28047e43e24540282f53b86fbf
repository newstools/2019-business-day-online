The price at which Interswitch brings forth its shares for sale to the public is now the focus for many prospective investors who are eagerly waiting for the Initial Public Offering (IPO). Interswitch, a Nigeria-based payments firm, has hired advisers to resurrect plans for a stock-market listing in London and Lagos later this year. Interswitch tried a dual IPO two years ago and this second attempt that is now underway comes at a time when the Nigerian stock market has lost over 11percent of its value at the beginning of this year. The payments company has hired JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Standard Bank Group as advisors for the IPO. The initial public offering may value the financial technology company at $1.3billion to $1.5-billion. The potential listing would follow those of two other major African and Middle Eastern tech company share sales this year. Jumia Technologies, dubbed the Amazon of Africa, listed in New York earlier this year, while Dubai-based payments firm Network International Holdings went public in London.
