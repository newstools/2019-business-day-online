Enoch Adeboye, The General Overseer of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, has said his silence over recent burning national issues was because the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria (PFN) and Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) had taken public positions on the issues, saying that the group’s views represented his position and that of the RCCG. Recall that a group of students and youths under the leadership of some notable artistes like Baba Fryo, Charley Boy and Eedris Abdulkarim, last week staged a peaceful protest at the Redemption Camp, urging Adeboye to speak on the killings of Christians, and the suspended plan by the federal government to establish cattle camps called Ruga. But in a statement to journalists over on Friday and signed by the church’s head, Media & Public Relations, Olaitan Olubiyi, Adeboye reaffirmed his commitment to the umbrella Christian organisations that are mandated to speak on issues affecting the Church and the nation as a whole. The clergy, a one-time President of PFN, noted that the aforementioned Christian bodies had spoken on the issues of kidnapping, killing of Christians, herdsmen attacks and general insecurity in Nigeria and that his position and that of the RCCG was not different from their expressed views. Adeboye further stated that his continued silence did not mean that he had not made his views on the issues known to all relevant authorities, stressing that very soon Nigerians would see that God answers prayers. He, however, enjoined all Nigerians to remain calm and maintain peace. “To be quiet does not mean that you are silent, his views on the issues known to all the relevant authorities, very soon, Nigerians shall see that God answers prayers,” the statement said. “The RCCG leader had always called the congregation to prayers against kidnapping, bloodshed and general insecurity at the monthly all-night Holy ghost Service held at the redemption camp.”  Iniobong Iwok
