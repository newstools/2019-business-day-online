 Nura Dahiru, an assistant superintendent of the Nigeria Customs Service, on Monday promoted himself to the rank of deputy comptroller-general of Customs (DCG), with claims that he was directed by President Muhammadu Buhari to assume the office of Comptroller-General (CG). Informed Sources told newsmen at the Customs headquarters in Abuja that Dahiru walked into the Comptroller-General’s office on Monday morning with the new rank. “As he came in, officers were saluting him because he was wearing that rank,” one of the sources said. “Sometime in May, he had posted on Facebook that he had been directed by the president to take over from Hameed Ali, the CG, and today when we saw him in the new rank, we thought, indeed, he has been promoted and so directed by the president. He went inside the CG’s office, sat in the waiting room, expecting the CG to handover to him,” the source said.
