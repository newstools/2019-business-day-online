The President of the Senate, Ahmad Lawan, on Monday dismissed invitation by the Forum of All Progressives Congress Chairmen to seek its intervention into a crisis between him and senators as the Ninth Assembly carries out its activities. He said the Senate and the Presidency have one focus and that their collective interest would unify the Senate as against individual interests that would tear them apart. Lawan said there may be moments of disagreement between him and his colleagues but that this would be resolved without the need to call on the Forum of chairmen of the party to intervene. Chairman of the All Progressives Congress Chairmen Forum, Ali Bukar Dalori, had obliged the President of the Senate the readiness of the Forum to intervene in any future crisis between him and senators with a view of settling the crisis. Lawan said the APC-dominated Senate will work with the executive for the common goal of national development, citing power generation and distribution as factors of unifying Nigerians. “When we campaigned for the election into the offices of the President of the Senate and Deputy President of the Senate the party must have seen how loyal and committed senators were. This was in clear difference with what happened in 2015. “Therefore, Mr. Chairman of chairmen, I don’t think I will ever invite you to come and intervene on my behalf when I will have any issue with any senator,” Lawan said. He also told Dalori that his call for unity of purpose was in support of the President.  “The Executive and the legislature in this respect, with dominance of APC in the Senate and the APC administration, have one cause, one focus and one direction.
