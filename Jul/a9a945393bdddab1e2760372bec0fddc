The Nigerian bond market commenced the second half of the year on a positive note as sustained investor appetite for no-risk assets plunged yields on Nigerian government bonds to their weakest level in three months. “Bond yields had risen to attractive level following the selloffs that we had last month,” Abimbola Omotola, fixed income analyst at Lagos-based Chapel Hill Denham, told BusinessDay. The decline was as a result of “renewed appetite for bonds as investors to get more duration exposure”.
