The Group Managing Director ofWindsorReal Estate Richard Vedelago, confirmed the development in a statement noting that the launch of the project further demonstrates Berkeley’s commitment to creating not just brand new homes but establishing new communities’ of high-quality and stylish design into the London Landscape. “We are delighted to have been selected by St. William to bring forward this opportunity, which is in its first phase and therefore forecasts are strong for early capital growth and good rental yields. Windsor’s mantra is to continuously offer the very best projects to our Nigerian clients and giving them amazing upside in the long run” he said. Vedelago said once complete, the project, whose first phase is called Hornsey Park Place, will deliver over 1,700 one, two and three-bedroom homes, incorporating a new 5 acre public park, together with a series of landscaped spaces and courtyards. Clarendon offers residents the opportunity to invest in an up and coming area of London, sitting between Hornsey, Wood Green and the expansive Alexandra Palace. The area is undergoing massive regeneration, which will further strengthen the scheme’s desirability. The scheme will also introduce over 100,000 sq ft of commercial space, creating a new vibrant London destination.   HARRISON EDEH,ABUJ‎A
