President Muhammadu Buhari has congratulated Nigerian writer, Lesley Nneka Arimah, for winning 2019 Caine Prize for African Writing. In a statement by Special Adviser to the President on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, President Buhari felicitated with the writer for the literary masterpiece, “Skinned’’, that won the award, commending her for the depth of insight and skilfulness in bringing up the issue of women inclusiveness, which continues to occupy the minds of leaders across the world, especially in Africa. The President believes Arimah’s award, with a book focused on empowering women, creates another platform for discussions and actions on a topical issue of development that every government must take seriously. President Buhari rejoiced with family and friends of the prolific writer, affirming that her brilliance has brought pride and glory to the country, and the continent. This is just as the President has also expressed his profound shock over the death of 19 passengers whose vehicles collided at Dinyar Madiga in Kano State during the weekend. The President said he received the news “with deep grief and empathy for the families of the unfortunate victims of the accident.” He urged all road users to continue to exercise caution and vigilance as they go from one place to the other. “As our roads get better with increased maintenance, drivers must use them with added caution and vigilance,” he said. President Buhari prayed that Almighty God will comfort families of the deceased at this difficult time and grant them the fortitude to bear this irreparable loss of loved ones, adding; “May the souls of the departed rest in peace. May God reward their good deeds with paradise.”  Tony Ailemen, Abuja
