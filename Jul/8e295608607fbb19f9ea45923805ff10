 Gani Adams, the Aare Onakakanfo of Yorubaland, has said the region should not be held accountable if there was a reprisal attack over Friday’s killing of Funke Olakunrin, daughter of the leader of pan-Yoruba socio-cultural group, Afenifere, Reuben Fasoranti. Adams, who is the Leader of Oodua People’s Congress (OPC), described Olakunrin’s killing by suspected herdsmen in Ondo State as one too many by the attackers, who are invading the South West in their numbers and perpetrating atrocities. In a statement by his Media Assistant, Kehinde Aderemi, on Saturday, the Aare Onakakanfo noted that the Yoruba race was not at a loss as to what to do to put a complete stop to the atrocities of the herdsmen, but had continuously issued statements so as to call the attention of the entire world to the development in the peaceful South West. He further stated that the Yoruba people were not afraid of acting and it was only being cautious. “They should be aware of the actions that preceded our reaction when it eventually comes. We are not bereft of ideas of how to stop this criminality on our land. “It is just so that we should not be blamed when the reaction comes. We are like the proverbial goat that it being chased. “When it gets to the wall, it will certainly react. “We are at that stage now,” Adams said. Adams said the Yoruba race had met over a period of three weeks on the security threat to the people, calling on Governors of the South West States to ensure the conclusion of the Security Summit process. He commiserated with the Fasoranti family, praying God to comfort him and his entire household.
