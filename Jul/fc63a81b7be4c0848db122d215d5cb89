Senegal edged Benin 1-0 to become the first nation to reach the semi-finals of the  2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in Egypt. A  second half goal by Everton midfielder Idrissa Gueye ended Benin’s tournament hopes. Gueye started and finished a move which saw Liverpool’s Sadio Mane tee up his team-mate to score in Cairo. The Video Assistant Referee system has been introduced from the quarter-final stage and Mane had two goals disallowed for offside after VAR checks. Senegal will meet the winner between Madagascar vs Tunisia in the semi-finals on Sunday in Cairo.
