 Unidentified gunmen have reportedly invaded the family house of controversial senator, Elisha Abbo in the early hours of Saturday and killed his uncle, Elder David Ella. The armed men numbering about 13 also kidnapped the lawmaker’s step-mother. Abbo who represents Adamawa North in the National Assembly, disclosed this in a chat with journalists in Abuja. The PDP senator who was recently caught in a viral video slapping a nursing mother at a sex toy shop in Abuja, also revealed that the abductors have reached out to him with a foreign number. Commenting on the incident, he said: “About 13 gunmen armed with AK 47, invaded my family house around 1am on Saturday and shot my uncle dead. “They dragged my father and brothers out of their rooms and went after my step-mother when they were told that my biological mother was late. “They took the poor woman away and left behind her 11-day-old child. “My step mother is still with the kidnappers now (as of 5:30pm on Saturday.) The kidnappers have called me with a Cameroonian MTN number but they had yet to demand ransom.” Abbo lamented that the kidnappers were camped just about two kilometres away from Mubi town but that neither the military nor the security operatives have been able to dislodge them. “The Federal Government, the military and the police are not doing enough in the aspect of insecurity in this country,” he said. “The security agencies and the military know the hideouts of the criminals but they will not go after them. “Of what use is the Army barracks and the Mobile Police base in Mubi when they cannot enter two kilometres into the bush and dislodge the kidnappers? “The kidnappers are using the ransom they are collecting to fund terrorism in this country.  That is just the truth.”
