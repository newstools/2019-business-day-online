The gains came despite a late listing of the telcoâ€™s shares at about 2.18pm Nigerian time. Airtel Africa Plc successfully listed more than 3.75 billion ordinary shares on the daily official list of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) Tuesday. The share price rose to N399.3 from a listing price of N363, with a total trade valued at N39.9 million. A source at the NSE said 100,000 units of shares were traded, intended to move the price. Unofficial source linked the transacted unit to Chapel Hill. The shares of Airtel were listed at the Lagos bourse at 2:18PM Nigerian time after the Chief Executive Officer of the NSE, Oscar Onyema, approved the request.
