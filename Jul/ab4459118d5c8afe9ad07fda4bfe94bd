Ahmadu Fintiri of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to its final conclusion The State Chairman of APC, Alhaji Ibrahim Bilal, made this known at a  press briefing in Yola on Saturday. Bilal urged the public and party members to disregard the speculation making the rounds, that the party had withdrawn its suit challenging the emergence of Fintiri and the governor of the state following an attempt by some party members who went to last week’s sitting of the tribunal with a lawyer who wanted to initiate a process of withdrawing the case. Bilal said the state party executives including the 21 local government chairmen of the party held an emergency meeting and resolved that the party would pursue the case to a final conclusion. “The state executives and 21 chairmen of the party want to call the attention of the general public that APC as a party has not withdrawn its case before the Governorship Election Tribunal challenging the victory of PDP governorship candidate. “We raise our voice loud to clear the air and to challenge the purported news making round that the party had withdrawn the case. “The Party has not withdrawn the case and would never, until the final conclusion,” Bilal said. He said that the party’s case filed before the governorship election tribunal sitting in Yola challenging the victory of PDP governorship candidate was, among others, seeking for nullification of election in 385 Polling units in 12 local government areas for non-compliance with the electoral Act and the declaration of APC candidate as winner of the governorship election.
