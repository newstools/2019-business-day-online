A non-governmental organisation under the aegis of Initiative for Developing Entrepreneurship and Advancing Human Potentials in Edo State on Wednesday urged the people of the state to support Governor Godwin Obaseki‘s quest for a second term in office. The group said the support will enable the governor to consolidate and sustain his good works, policies and programmes. Mentor Excel Osamwenyobo, president of the group, in a statement made available to journalists in Benin City, noted that the governor deserves second term in office as a result of his performance and commitment to the development of the state. Osamwenyobo also lauded achievements of the governor in the last three years, saying they stand him out as a performing governor. According to her, the governor’s achievements speak volumes and it can be seen in infrastructure, human capital, education, internally generated revenue (IGR), Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and industry, agriculture, among others. “Governor Obaseki has pioneered a number of policy reforms that saw the state restructure its public finance, secure funding for infrastructural development and improve the business climate to attract investment in power, agriculture and other critical sectors,” she said. She explained that the governor had also launched the Edo Basic Education Transformation (Edo BEST) programme, an initiative designed to train and equip public school teachers with requisite skills and expertise for deploying Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in classrooms to improve learning outcomes. “The governor also revamped the Government Science and Technical College (formerly Benin Technical College) to train the workforce in a bid to solve the problem of dearth of technical skills and technologically competent hands in the state,” she said
