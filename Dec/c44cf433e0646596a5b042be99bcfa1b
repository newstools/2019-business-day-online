He carried on by drawing the attention to their mandate to create ideas and be innovative in generating opportunities across Nigeria. “Nigeria’s population is estimated to be over 230 million people. We must be intentional in raising awareness for the next generation, my generation to know that their talent is a currency and it can be spent globally with the right platform and support,” Ogoloma stated. “I am looking forward to building more partnerships in Nigeria with those who share the same passion as me,” he also added.
