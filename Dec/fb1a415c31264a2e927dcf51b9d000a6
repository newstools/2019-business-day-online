Nigeria’s inflation rate rose in November as food prices continued climbing following border closures a government agency said Tuesday. Consumer prices rose 11.9% from a year earlier compared with 11.6% in October, the Abuja-based National Bureau of Statistics said in a report published on its website. The median of three economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg survey was 11.8%. · Nigeria’s central bank held its benchmark rate at 13.5% for a fourth straight meeting in November, saying the impact of the country’s borders closures — designed to stem smuggling — on prices will be “reactionary and temporary.” · Food inflation quickened to 14.5% from 14.1% in October. The price of imported rice, Nigeria’s preferred staple, has risen since August, after President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the border closures. · The International Monetary Fund warned last month Nigeria will experience further inflationary pressures due to excess liquidity in the banking system, driven by negative real yields on short-term government bonds.
