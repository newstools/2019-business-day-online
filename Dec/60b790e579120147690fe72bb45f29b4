The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has urged Nigerians to pray against poor management of the country’s economy and resources by an inept government. It also called for prayers against flagrant abuse of human rights; continuing rape of democracy and the destruction of the time-worn principles of separation of powers, as well as the several avoidable killings of Nigerians and general state of insecurity in the country. The Caucus led by Kingsley Chinda (PDP, Rivers) stated this in a message of felicitation with Christians across the globe, particularly those in Nigeria on the occasion of this year’s Christmas celebrations. “While we rejoice and celebrate with Christians on this event which marks the birth of Jesus Christ, we urge Christians to pray for the peace, unity and progress of our dear country, Nigeria, particularly against the backdrop of the numerous of challenges facing us as a Nation. “We also urge Christians to continue to exhibit the qualities of Christ, for which the spirit of tolerance, sacrifice, mutual love and peaceful co-existence with other Nigerians are the hallmarks. “Once more, congratulations and we wish all Christians happy and joyous Christmas celebrations”, the message read.
