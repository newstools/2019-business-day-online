The Minority Leader of the House of Representatives, Ndudi Elumelu has declared that the opposition caucus will step up its oversight activities in order to ensure effective monitoring and implementation of the N10.59 trillion budget for 2020 fiscal year. Elumelu in a statement in Abuja on Sunday said the Minority leadership has already worked out an end-to-end monitoring strategy that will ensure effective implementation, check corruption, diversions and plug waste. The Minority Leader noted that Nigerians have placed confidence on the opposition for solution and as such has directed opposition lawmakers to braced up to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that budgetary provisions, especially those that have direct bearing on the well-being of the masses, are all fully and evenly implemented. Elumelu therefore directed all opposition lawmakers to insist on intensified budget oversight in their respective Committees to guarantee transparency and strict compliance to expenditure items, figures and location, as passed. According to him, part of the implementation monitoring strategy is to stimulate citizensâ€™ ownership of budgetary project by carrying the people along through free flow of information, especially on siting, size, utility, cost, releases and job execution progress. The Minority Leader called on all lawmakers to ensure effective and timely implementation of constituency projects in line with their avowed commitment to the people. He also tasked Ministries and agencies to exert its implementation capacity to ensure that all funds released to them are fully utilized and accounted for. Elumelu however cautioned Ministries, Departments and Agencies, particularly revenue-generating ones to bear in mind that Nigerians are already economically stressed and as such should develop more efficacious wealth-creating strategies that do not place more burden on the citizens. The Minority Leader assured that the opposition will not relent but redouble its efforts in protecting the interest of the people while constructively disallowing any programme and policy that are inimical to the health of the nation.
