Millions of residents of Lagos can look to switching to the Lagos-Lekki brand of rice popularly called LAKE Rice this festive season, as the Lagos State government is flagging off a state-wide distribution of the commodity today, Tuesday.  Commissioner for agriculture, Gbolahan Lawal, is billed to flag off the distribution in Agege this afternoon, on behalf of Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu.  The Lake rice was first introduced by the administration of Akinwunmi Ambode in 2015 following an agreement signed between Lagos and Kebbi States to boost rice production and encourage other produce in the agro value chain. The rice is majorly produced by local farmers in Kebbi while Lagos serves as an uptaker because of its huge market.

An unofficial source, however, told BusinessDay that the government may stick to the prices it offered during the Moslem festivity, Eid-el-kabir, earlier this year.  The state government had raised the prices slightly above what it originally offered when it introduced rice in 2015/2016.  Hence, the 50Kg bag which used to sell at N12,000 was earlier in the year sold for N14,000; 25kg bag which formerly sold at N6,000 was N7,000 while 10kg bag was sold for N3, 000 instead of the normal N2000.  The rice will be available at local council offices and some other designated places to be announced by the government.  …More details coming.
