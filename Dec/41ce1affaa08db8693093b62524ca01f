The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Adams Oshiomhole has congratulated the winner of the Saturday’s Kogi West Senatorial supplementary election, Smart Adeyemi over his victory. Adeyemi, the APC candidate had contested against Dino Melaye, Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the Kogi West rerun held on the Saturday, November 16 but the election was declared inconclusive as the number of cancelled votes was said to be more than the margin of lead. Consequently the Independent National Electoral National Commission (INEC) had supplementary election into the over 50 polling units cancelled after which, Adeyemi defeated Melaye. Oshiomhole in a statement he personally signed on Saturday night said, the victory has again affirmed the general acceptance of APC by the great people of Kogi State who just few weeks ago voted massively for the party’s governorship candidate, Yahaya Bello who was re-elected for a second term. “I congratulate our newly elected Senator, Smart Adeyemi on his well deserved victory in the Kogi West re-run election which held today. “I have always believed in the ability of the people of Kogi West to elect leaders who will make them proud in the Senate and not the defeated Senator Melaye who is among the 16 Senators who rebelled against our party. “As it stands today, the broom has swept away the entire 16 Senators, Dino being the last, who tried to destabilise our democracy for their personal interest, jettisoning the interest of the electorate. “On behalf of our great party the APC, I congratulate my brother and friend, Senator Smart Adeyemi once again and we look forward toward working with you in this resolve by our dear President, Muhammadu Buhari to take the nation to the NEXT LEVEL”, he stated.
