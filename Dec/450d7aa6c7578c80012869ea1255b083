Individuals who stress over the amount of time they spend on WhatsApp can now look forward to receiving financial rewards while playing PREWIN Games on the app. PREWIN Games is a trivia platform that educates and rewards players on different subject areas of interest. It also comes as a mobile application and can also be played on the web. According to the Global State of Digital 2019 report, WhatsApp is the most used social media platform in Nigeria with at least 85 percent of Nigeria’s 24 million active social media users on the platform. “People spend a lot of time on WhatsApp either connecting with friends, families, business partners or colleagues,” said Adekunle Akindeji, managing director and CEO of PREWIN at the launch of the platform in Lagos recently. “With time being such an intangible resource, we came up with the idea of PREWIN Games for people to get educated and rewarded in this knowledge-based economy. We know Nigerians are knowledgeable so why not reward them from the comfort of their mobile device.” For users, the least amount to play with is N100 and the maximum is N10,000 which means the least you win is N1000 and the maximum is N100,000. There are charges on the select versions of the game for N100 and excluding bank charges which are standard when making withdrawals from banks. Users can play as many times as they want. It is one game with different categories of choice as selected by the player.  The different categories include sports, fashion, politics, entertainment, general trivia to mention a few.
