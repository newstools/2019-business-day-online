Boris Johnson’s Conservative Party has officially won the UK election, passing the 326-seat threshold with constituencies still to declare. The BBC forecasts that Boris Johnson will return to Downing Street with a majority of 74. The prime minister said it would give him a mandate to “get Brexit done” and take the UK out of the EU next month. Jeremy Corbyn said Labour had a “very disappointing night” and he would not fight a future election. Labour have lost seats across the North, Midlands and Wales in places which backed Brexit in 2016.  Speaking after he was re-elected in Uxbridge, west London, with a slightly higher majority, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “It does look as though this One Nation Conservative government has been given a powerful new mandate to get Brexit done.” He added: “Above all I want to thank the people of this country for turning out to vote in a December election that we didn’t want to call but which I think has turned out to be a historic election that gives us now, in this new government, the chance to respect the democratic will of the British people to change this country for the better and to unleash the potential of the entire people of this country.” Speaking at his election count in Islington North, where he was re-elected with a reduced majority, Mr Corbyn said Labour had put forward a “manifesto of hope” but “Brexit has so polarised debate it has overridden so much of normal political debate”. Labour’s vote is down around 8% on the 2017 general election, with the Tories up by just over 1% and the smaller parties having a better night.  BBC
