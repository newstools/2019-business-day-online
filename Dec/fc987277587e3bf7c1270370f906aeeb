Members of the Nigerian Integrated Reporting Committee (NIRC) at its recent gathering in Lagos identified three pillars that will be pivotal to the promotion of Integrated Reporting in Nigeria. Innocent Okwuosa, Chairman, Nigerian Integrated Reporting Committee and a Council member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria (ICAN) gave an insight into the strategic action plan of the Committee in a media chat after the strategic session. Okwuosa, who is also a member of Africa Integrated Reporting Council (AIRC), said the Committee’s strategic action plan is built around three pillars: awareness/advocacy, engagement and capacity building. These three pillars have actionable programmes that have been further grouped into short term, medium term and long-term plans. He further stated that awareness and advocacy programmes will see the NIRC engaging with both private and public sector organisations in Nigeria including listed companies and MDAs. According to him, “NIRC will be meeting and addressing top management and policy makers of corporate reporting regulators like Financial Reporting Council of Nigeria (FRCN), Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), National Insurance Commission (NAICOM), National Pension Commission (PenCom), Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), Federal Inland Revenue Services (FIRS), Ministry of Finance, Accountant General Office, Auditor General office among others. Okwuosa said the Committee will author two documents that will provide conceptual clarification of integrated thinking and reporting and how organisations in Nigeria should approach it. It would be recalled that NIRC was inaugurated on October 17, 2019by the President, Institute of Chartered Accountants of Nigeria, Mazi Nnamdi Okwuadogbo, further to the approval of the governing council of ICAN granted in 2018 to establish the Committee.
