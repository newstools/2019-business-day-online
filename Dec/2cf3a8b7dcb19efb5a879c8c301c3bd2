The United States House of Representatives Wednesday night impeached President Trump  on a two-count charge of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House voted 230-197 (Democrats -Republicans) to charge president Trump with abuse of power and 229-198 for obstructing congress. He becomes the third US president in history to be impeached by the House of Representatives, setting up a trial in the Senate that will decide whether he remains in office. Many say though he may not be removed from office by the Senate, it is a “bad mark on him”. The impeachment came through after a six-hour debate presided over by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Trump was at the time holding a Christmas MAGA rally in Michigan where he called on his supporters to “vote Pelosi the hell out of office”. Pelosi, speaking right after the House impeached President Trump, said today is “a great day for the Constitution” but “a sad day for America.” The House voted on two charges – that the president abused his power and that he had obstructed Congress. Both votes fell along party lines with nearly all Democrats voting for the charges and all Republicans against. As voting took place, President Trump was addressing a campaign rally. He told a cheering crowd in Battle Creek, Michigan: “While we’re creating jobs and fighting for Michigan, the radical left in Congress is consumed with envy and hatred and rage, you see what’s going on.” The White House released a statement saying that the president was “confident that he will be fully exonerated” in a Senate trial.
