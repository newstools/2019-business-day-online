On a month on month basis, the headline index settled at 1.02 percent slightly lower than the rate reported in October (1.07%). Core inflation trod a similar path, inching upwards by 0.79% on a monthly basis. The uptick in inflation will weigh on the upcoming Treasury Bills and Bonds primary market auctions this week as investors are likely to demand higher yields to match rising inflation.

Prices of staples continued to rise, pushing the food index upwards by 14.48% compared to 14.09% in October. The increase was spurred by the increase in prices of bread, cereals, oils and fats, meat, yam and fish. The price increase will further erode the purchasing power of consumers.
