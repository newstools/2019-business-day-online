We believe that participation in these collaborative efforts are critical in making our voices heard and bringing an end to sexual violence in our society” Sexual violence affects all lives and the No Tolerance March was a chance to say No to Rape, Sexual Violence, Child Sexual Abuse, Sex Trafficking and other harmful practices in our communities.
