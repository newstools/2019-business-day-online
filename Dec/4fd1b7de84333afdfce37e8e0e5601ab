The Nigerian equities market closed negative on Thursday December 19 supporting earlier expectations that the market will remain bearish this week due to continued sell-offs. The disappointing outing at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) was fuelled among others by decline in prices of MTNN, UPDC REIT, UACN, Access Bank, and International Breweries Plc. “We expect equity market performance to remain    volatile for the rest of the week as bargain hunters and profit takers continue to visit the exchange,” according to research analysts at United Capital Plc. “A mid-session decline in MTNN cemented the loss for the All Share Index (ASI) while the session was generally mixed otherwise”, said Lagos-based analysts at Vetiva Securities. They expect investors to carefully hunt for bargains on certain stocks which depreciated in Thursday’s session, adding that activity in the market heavyweights will ultimately determine the direction of the ASI. As such, they foresee a mild recovery for the Nigerian bourse on Friday.
