The Conservatives have taken a string of former Labour strongholds, with the party forecast to win the general election with a comfortable majority.  Leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a “very disappointing night for the Labour Party” – and will resign. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has lost her seat to the Scottish National Party. The BBC is now forecasting the Tories will get a majority of 76, less than the 86 originally predicted. Labour have lost seats in the North, Midlands and Wales in areas which backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum.
They are set to win 65 fewer seats than in 2017, it is suggested.
