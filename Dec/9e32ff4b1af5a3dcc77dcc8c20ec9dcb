Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State has described as false and malicious reports that went viral on social media on Friday which attracted reactions about a purported impeachment plot against principal officers of the Taraba State House of Assembly, including Abel Peter Diah, the speaker. This came barely hours after a publication on a social media platform alleged some mapped out plans by the governor to siphon over two hundred million naira (N200,000,000) from the treasury of the state’s Universal Basic Education (UBE), to buy up state legislators in order to change the entire leadership of the state Assembly. But in a statement signed by Bala Dan Abu, his senior special assistant on media and publicity, a copy of which was made available to newsmen in  Jalingo Saturday, the governor described the allegations as untrue. “It is yet another wicked and malicious attempt to cause confusion and conflict in the relationship between the executive and legislative arms of government in the state on the one hand and Governor Ishaku and Peter Diah, his political godson, on the other. “Both men have had several years of fruitful personal and official relationships nurtured by mutual trust, cooperation and collaboration,” the statement said. It further explained that Governor Ishaku would never sponsor and did not sponsor the so-called impeachment move, if indeed there was any such move by the honourable members, let alone fund it with such a staggering amount of money from the public purse. “The allegations are ridiculous, absolutely false and malicious. It is certainly for these reasons that the author of the article failed to sign it. Governor Ishaku wants the general public to ignore this article and the lies contained in it,” he added. The statement however, described Ishaku as an apostle of peace who will not do anything that will rock the existing level of trust and understanding between him and members of the state House of Assembly.
