Dangote Cement Plc has scheduled an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) for 22nd of January, 2020, to consider the companyâ€™s proposed share buyback programme among other issues. According to the circular published on the Nigerian Stock Exchange, Dangote Cement plans to buy back 10percent of its outstanding shares and thereafter cancel those shares within ten (10) business days of the last date of completion of the programme.
The company intends to fund the programme from its reserves which stood at N731.2billion as at September, 2019. The share buy-back provides support for Dangote Cement share price which declined in 2019 and drive long term shareholder value.  Iheanyi Nwachukwu
