Meanwhile, Dangote Flour and Global Spectrum Energy Services have postponed their annual general meetings having received authorisation from the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC). The move by Dangote Flour to postpone its AGM followed its earlier announcement to the effect that it had received a binding offer on April 23,2019 from Olam International Limited for the acquisition of the issued shares of the company. “Based on the forthcoming court ordered meeting, the board is of the considered opinion that it will not be practical nor effective to convene an AGM before the court ordered meeting and has therefore sought and obtained the approval of the CAC to hold the AGM no later than December 21, 2019. In view of the fact that the outcome of the court ordered meeting is unknown, the board is unable to propose a specific date for the AGM at this time”, a notice signed by Aisha Ladi Isa, company’s secretary, stated. Global Spectrum Energy Services attributed its inability to hold its AGM to logistics issues. The company has promised to hold it on or before December 31, 2019.
