Going by huge foreign exchange annually spent on importation of barley malt for the production of beer and malt drink in Nigeria, International Breweries PLC, a subsidiary of AB Inbev Group, says it now source 40percent of its local raw materials. The organisation also notes that it has successfully stimulated the local economy and agribusiness with increasing demand for sorghum and other agricultural produce used to brew alcoholic and non-alcholic beverages in its plants located in three geopolitical zones of the country. According to an official statement made available to BusinessDay, there is a systematic move to increase on annual basis, the local sourcing of raw materials used by the brewery firm in such a way that the taste, quality, and premium of its alcoholic and non-alcholic drinks are not affected and tampered with. In a factory tour organised by the firm, Michael Daramola, director- legal and corporate affairs, IB declared that demands for sorghums and other agricultural products used in production of beer and non-alcholic beverages are on the increase and several clusters of farmers across the country and foods and agribusiness firms such as Olam Nigeria are already benefitting. Although, Daramola assured consumers of beers and malt drinks brewed by the organisation that there would not be sudden removal of some foreign inputs in order to tamper with the taste, quality, and premium of its products, he however said there would be an increase in the local sourcing of raw materials such as sorghum and others as part of corporate governance and desire to help Nigerian economy grow. The brewer also shared some of its corporate social investment (CSI) initiatives to further highlight its sustainability practices. These efforts are aimed at supporting the socio-economic development of Nigeria through its initiatives in the on Education, Health, Empowerment, Infrastructure support, and Responsible drinking.
