Nigeria has the largest market in Africa with a population of approximately 200 million people. In 2017, the Economic Complexity Index ranked Nigeria as the 49th largest export economy in the world and the 124th most complex economy. The country’s foreign trade statistics, which is the export and import value, shows how it has competed in the global market place. Nigeria exported $52.9 billion worth of goods around the globe in 2018. This value represented a decline of 46.7 per cent since 2014 but an increase of 29.9 per cent from $46.8 billion in 2017. However, exported products in 2017 increased by 27 per cent when compared with preceding year 2016. The increase in trade value had a positive trade balance of $12.7 billion in net exports, as compared to a trade deficit of about $538 million in 2016. Trade as of 2017 accounted for 26.3 per cent of Nigeria’s GDP which amounted a 6 per cent increase compared with 2016. Put differently, the country recorded a trade growth of 11.56 per cent compared to a world growth of 1.50 per cent, thus, GDP for the considered period stood at $375.7 billion. Nigeria exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP was 13.17 per cent and imports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP is 13.18 per cent in 2017. This improvement could be attributed to the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), launched in early 2017, which led to policies amendment and new policies were enacted to help exit Nigeria from the recession that hit the country in 2016. These policies included the Investor and Exporter Foreign Exchange Window (IEFX) and a tightening of the monetary policy, decrease in inflationary rate. And again, the combination of higher oil revenues and positive policy decisions also contributed to the rejuvenation of the economy. This led to an increase in capital inflow (the sum total of the foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio and other investment equal $12 billion in 2017, more than doubled of the previous year value.
