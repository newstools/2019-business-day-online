Stocks like Guinness Nigeria Plc (-59.2percent), International Breweries Plc (- 58.7percent ) , Glaxosmithkline Consumer Nigeria Plc (-51percent), Nigerian Breweries Plc (- 46.2percent) helped fuel the negative returns seen this year at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). As at Friday, October 11, they have witnessed in excess of 40percent negative return, INVESTOR checks show. Other stocks that have underperformed remarkably this year are Forte Oil Plc (-44.3percent), Neimeth Plc (-48.7percent), Presco Plc (- 40percent), PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc (-47.9percent), UAC Property Development Company Plc (-41.9percent), Unity Bank Plc (-41.1percent), University Press Plc (-47.2percent), and Champion Breweries Plc (-47.7percent). Though the negative sentiment around some of these stocks persists because there are still no major catalysts, especially policies by the nation’s economic managers that can boost investor confidence, long-term investors stand to benefit from the longterm growth that they offers. As a result investors with longterm investment horizon should begin to take position in some of these stocks at their current prices, which market watchers believe offer significant upside potentials. Stocks that recorded negative returns of over 20 percent this year are: CAP Plc (-26.7percent), Cement Company of Northern Nigeria Plc (-21.6percent), Conoil Plc (- 33.8percent), Dangote Cement Plc (-24percent), Dangote Sugar Refinery Plc (-33.1percent), Eterna Plc (-33percent), and FBN Holdings Plc (-32.1percent).
