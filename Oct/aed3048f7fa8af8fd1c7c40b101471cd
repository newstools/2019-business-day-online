This act along with its resilient performance leaves investors with reasons to hang on to the shares of the bank despite the turbulence in the equities market,” the research analysts at Capital Bancorp Plc stated. “The Company’s results present a mixed tale of economic realities, resilience and best in class. The decline of 3.33percent in the company’s gross earnings is a reflection of economic realities. However, the bank grew her operating income by 1.94percent as a show of resilience and a flow with the tide. Interestingly, the last GDP growth rate released by National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) was 1.94percent. Best in class is what you call a company that holds her expenses at record levels, if I cannot earn more, I shouldn’t spend more. Riding on its efficiency, the bank delivered a growth in profit of 3.35percent at a cost-to-income rate of 36percent.
