Experts in the Nigerian capital markets and around the world have gathered in Abuja on Thursday for BusinessDay investing in capital markets conference to brainstorm on the ways to boost the capital market. The keynote address will be delivered by the Minister of Finance , Budget and National Planning, Zainab Ahmed. The theme of the conference is “market recovery, innovation and regulation in Nigeria”, which is apt in the sense that it is aimed at addressing the enormous challenges currently facing the nation’s capital market. Publisher/CEO of BusinessDay Frank Aigbogun is leading other experts to highlight the issues. BusinessDay is the leading media platform for business and financial Intelligence reporting in West Africa and at the forefront to interrogate the variables and proffer solutions that may reverse the continuous southward movement of the indexes at the capital markets. Investors have reportedly lost about N1.5 trillion due to speculations occasioned by the absence of catalysts that will attract both the local and foreign investors back to the market. Despite the challenges however, the capital market still has the potentials to host long term investment but it needs immediate recovery and this is where innovation of the regulators is needed.
