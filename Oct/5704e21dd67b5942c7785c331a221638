Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba State on Tuesday said Nigeria did not achieve the desired development at 59 years of its existence as an independent nation. Ishaku disclosed this at a media briefing to mark the independence anniversary. “Yes, we are 59 years old, but I don’t think we are 59 years mature; it is both sweet and ugly. “It is sweet because we have Independence, but ugly because we have not been able to utilise the 59 years to take the country to an enviable position. It’s a shame that Nigeria as the giant of Africa is still lagging behind. I visited Rwanda and I was amazed at their development in the healthcare sector alone.

A lot still need to be done, we need to change our thinking, work hard in education, health and power among others,” he said. “If we can improve on power alone, the multiplying effects will be tremendous, because, power drives the economic and social life of a country,” he said. Ishaku, who won his reelection case at the governorship tribunal in Abuja, recently returned to Taraba on Monday where he was received by his supporters. While thanking the people of Taraba for voting for him in their large numbers, Ishaku commended the judiciary for their upright judgment in the case against him by Prof. Sani Yahaya of the All Progressives Congress (APC).
