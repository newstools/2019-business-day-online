Nigeria’s apex court, the Supreme Court, will on Wednesday hear the appeal by the candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 23 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, against the judgment of the Presidential Election Petitions Tribunal that affirmed the election of President Muhammadu Buhari. The hearing would be coming nearly 50 days after the tribunal’s verdict which affirmed the return of Buhari for a second term in office and nearly 40 days after Atiku and the PDP filed their appeal seeking to nullify the judgment and be declared lawful winners of the presidential poll. This was disclosed by Taofik Gani, Publicity Secretary of the PDP in Lagos State, Monday, who noted that the party had been notified of the date.

The apex court is yet to make public the exact date the hearing will commence and list members of the panel. Also the PDP’s official Twitter page equally confirmed the development Monday. The tweet reads, “Breaking News! The Supreme Court of Nigeria has scheduled to hear the Appeal of the @OfficialPDPNig and @atiku / @PeterObi, arising from the judgment of the Appeal Court, on Wednesday, October 30, 2019. It’s time to #RescueNigeria.” Although the Supreme Court is yet to announce the members of the panel, it is believed that the apex court would not deviate from the norms of nominating the most senior justices into the panel.
