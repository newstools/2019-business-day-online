The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) has condemned Saturday evening’s attack on the Benin residence of the Party’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole by suspected political thugs. APC said although, the National Chairman has rightly called for calm after the apparent attempt on his life, it asked the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammad Adamu and other relevant security outfits to investigate the ugly incident and prosecute the sponsors and attackers. Lanre Issa-onilu, APC National Publicity Secretary in a statement noted that in Edo State, just as in any other state, everyone must be free to go about their normal and legitimate activities without harassment, intimidation, threat to life and property. “It is clear that the sponsors of the attack are bent on causing crisis in the state in pursuit of their desperate and unpopular political interests. Human life is greater than anyone’s political ambition”, he stated.  James Kwen, Abuja
