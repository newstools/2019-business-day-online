Sapio Club Nigeria, a group that brings together young people with love for intellectually stimulating activities is championing a campaign to get more of its members to become involved and better informed in the governance of the country. In a recent meetup where it also awarded some political leaders, the group said to build Nigeria as a nation, young people who are well educated will have to get actively involved. The meetup, therefore, served as a platform for members of the club to network, share ideas and engage productively in civic activities aimed at charting the course for a new Nigeria and place the country on a pedestal for sustainable growth and development. The Sapio – derived from the Latin word “sapien”, meaning wise – is the first Nigerian formed social group created for intellectuals. “It is a formidable force for diverse intellectual African citizens, proposing and implementing homegrown solutions for our development,” a statement from the group to BusinessDay said. The theme for this year’s meetup was Unity and patriotism which is a prerequisite for national development. The night was particularly engaging with a panel of discussants which included Joyce Akpata, DG Nigerian American Chamber of commerce; Babajide Obanikoro, Federal House of Representative member, representing Eti Osa constituency; Henry Esiaba, Lead, creative marketing Airtel; Moremi Ojomu, Youth Inclusion in Government; and Sonia Agu, Founder, Sapio Club. The discussions were centered around proposing result-driven solutions to issues everyday Nigerians are faced with and how Nigeria’s unity can be strengthened by utilizing its diversity. The Senior Special Assistant to the Executive Governor of Lagos State on Diaspora and Foreign Relations, Jermaine Sanwo-Olu received an excellence award for his service to the diaspora; while Ibrahim Obanikoro, was presented with the Youth in Leadership Award; and Seyi Tinubu, CEO and Founder of Loatsad Promo Media Ltd received the Excellence Award for his outstanding achievements in Media Enterprise amongst others.
