Uber Technology Inc., launched a pilot phase of its boat business in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital, on Friday in conjunction with Texas Connection Ferries, a local boat operator, and the Lagos State Waterways Authority. Uber’s Chief Business Officer Brooks Entwistle said in June that the company was in talks with Lagos state government and regulatory authorities to start UberBoats to ease traffic congestion in the city of 20 million people, whose vast and underutilized waterways are seen as a viable transportation alternative to relieve pressure on the roads.

Customers will also get 50 percent discount on Uber taxis when used for rides to the boat jetty. UberBoat will only be operational on weekdays from 8am to 5pm for N500 ($1.39) per trip, the ride-hailing company said.
