Following the suspension of Mohammed Awobimpe and Baba Malik, chairman and vice chairman, respectively of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Ifelodun Local Government Area of Kwara State, the party has warned against the indiscriminate suspension of party members and unconstitutional act that could cause crisis within the party at the state level. It was gathered that Awobimpe Malik allegedly mismanaged funds and involved in anti-party activities, hence, their suspension at a meeting held by the executives, APC elders and other stakeholders in the council, giving room for Olurotimi Ajisafe, APC secretary of the area to assume the position of APC chairman in acting capacity. Speaking in Ilorin, Kwara Sate capital on Tuesday against the suspension of  the APC Chairman and Vice Chairman of Ifelodun Local Government, the state APC State Chairman, Bashir Bolarinwa expressed dismay over wanton and reckless removal of party officers by “the congregation of  disgruntled, selfish and attention-seeking elements in the party”. The party chairman, who decried a situation where one would labour to build a house and later be found destroying the house, warned that the organs of the party would no longer condone recklessness and activities inimical to the growth and unity of APC through application of appropriate sanctions. Bolarinwa wondered why a party which was formed for the liberation of kwarans, is now being deployed by some desperate politicians who are fixated with personal gains as a vehicle of torment for the same kwarans. He therefore, declared as null and void the suspension of all officers embarked upon without due diligence, as laid down by the party’s constitution.  SIKIRAT SHEHU, Ilorin
