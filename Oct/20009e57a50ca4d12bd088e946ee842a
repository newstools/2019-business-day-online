Henry Iseghohi, the chief executive officer of Broadbased Communications Limited , an open access metropolitan fiber optic network company, has been awarded for his outstanding contribution to the telecommunications industry by the Association of telecom companies of Nigeria (ATCON), during its Nigeria Tech and Innovation Awards 2019, held in Lagos recently. Broadbased Communications Limited which operates an open access metropolitan fibre optic network covering all major districts in Lagos also won the Wholesale Telecom Provider of the Year 2019 and the Metropolitan Fiber Infrastructure Company of the Year 2019 Awards. Consequently the company provides Fiber Optic Network connectivity for Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), 4G network operators, all the submarine cable landing stations, all major internet service providers, all data centers, Nigeria internet exchange point, major global telecom operators, all the banks, the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), all electronic payment switching and processing companies, oil companies, major corporate firms and residential estates in partnership with other telecom service providers in each estate. Henry Iseghohi said that, “these awards are testaments to the company’s dedication to the open access model, the goodwill of our esteemed customers, the hard work and dedication of the staff of Broadbased Communications who have installed and maintain over 3,500km of fiber optic cable connected to 22 points of presence in Lagos with additional metro fiber networks in Kano, Akwa Ibom and points of presence in Abuja, Port Harcourt and Enugu. According to him, capital expenditure required to deploy fiber is huge and companies do not need to duplicate such huge expenditures when they can share their fiber network infrastructure with other duly licensed operators. Iseghohi  is a strong advocate of licensed operators coming together to address the varied issues facing the telecom sector in Nigeria including the effect of the major corporate customers on pricing for leased line services, their use of unlicensed operators, indiscriminate destruction of cable network infrastructure by road construction companies, access to low interest rate funds for network deployment amongst others.
