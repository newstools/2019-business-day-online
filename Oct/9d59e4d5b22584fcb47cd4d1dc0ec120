The Kogi State chapter of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has inaugurated its campaign committee for the governorship election slated for November 16 in the state. The state Chairman of the party, Samuel Uhuotu, while speaking at the inauguration in Lokoja on Friday, tasked the committee to ensure issue-based campaign. He equally advised the committee to shun hate speech and heaping of insult on other candidates. The chairman emphasised that the party’s governorship candidate, Musa Wada remains the man to beat in the forthcoming election, adding that the poor performance of Yahaya Bello had made the election a walk over for him. Speaking also, the Director-General of Musa/Aro Governorship Campaign Organisation, Tajudeen Yusuf, gave the assurance that his committee had already concluded arrangements to ensure a robust campaign to all parts of the state, as he pledged that the campaign would be issued-based and peaceful but warned security agents, especially the police and civil defence corps to remain neutral during and after the election. Yusuf also called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to create a level playing ground for all the parties contesting the election. Also speaking, the National Publicity Secretary of the PDP, Kola Ologbondiyan, urged the people of the state to use the opportunity of the election to liberate themselves from misrule, poverty and other forms of injustice, as he expressed delight over the large turnout of the people at the event, saying that the party was poised to win the election free and fair. The governorship candidate of the party, Musa Wada, in his speech called on the people to vote massively for him in the forth-coming election, as he promised to provide quality service and restore the lost glory of the state in the areas of agriculture, sports, solid minerals tourism and culture. The PDP flag bearer equally assured the people that all parts of the state will enjoy dividends of democracy if he becomes the governor, adding that his administration’s priority will be staff welfare, prompt payment of salary and pension .
