SeedMoney Africa has announced the addition of melon seeds to the list of agricultural products that can be traded on its platform. In a recent press briefing, SeedMoney Africa which describes itself as an agritech company that enables anyone from anywhere in the world to buy and sell African agricultural produce stated that it has started taking pre-orders for melon seeds. ”Clients who pre-order on the platform will be given priority to buy selected produce once the next season kicks off in November, ” Simi Ajayi, CMO of SeedMoney Africa said in a statement. “SeedMoney operates on a first come first served basis and by releasing the pre-order function; we ensure more customers are allowed to invest when prices are at their lowest,” Ajayi said. “We are constantly on the look-out for new ways to extend our product offering so that our customers can make a good return throughout the year,” he added. SeedMoney is focused on expanding and replicating its operations in selected African territories. Catherine Lückhoff, co-founder in SeedMoney Africa, shared that the dynamic company is setting its eyes on operations in East Africa. “If SeedMoney is going to compete globally, then we have to be resolute in our determination to establish a more structured and efficient market place that represents produce from across Africa using all the technology and skillsets we have at our disposal,” Luckhoff said. According to a statement, the organisation is heavily investing in three key areas namely its platform, its product offering as well as its data analytics – powered by machine learning – to ensure its competitive edge in the market and returns for its customers.
