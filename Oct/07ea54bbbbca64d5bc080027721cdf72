Oil-giant, Royal  Dutch Shell, in a preliminary disclosure for the third quarter ending September said its Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) output increased by at least 10percent, however, its upstream output slumped 2.7percent and charges up to $850 million for the third quarter. A snapshot of results ahead of its full quarterly earnings statement, scheduled for October 31, Shell puts its Q3 upstream production at 2.60 million-2.65 million b/d of oil equivalent, down from 2.67million boe/d in the third quarter 2018, without indicating the oil and gas split. Shell noted that the end-of-quarter statement was in response to investor feedback and part of efforts to increase transparency. According to Shell, prices for gas and natural gas liquids continued to be “disconnected” from Brent benchmark oil prices, reflecting exceptionally weak gas market conditions, indicating an uptick in write-offs for unsuccessful exploration drilling, saying well write-offs would be $250 million-350 million higher than in Q3 2018, when the write-off level was $149 million.
