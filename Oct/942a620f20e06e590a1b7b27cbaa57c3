Members of the Kogi State House of Assembly on Friday in Lokoja impeached Simon Achuba, Deputy Governor of Kogi State from office. The Majority Leader of the House disclosed this to reporters at the premises of the Sate Assembly complex. Achuba’s impeachment followed the submission of a report of the committee set up by the State Chief Judge, Justice Nasir Ajana, to investigate an allegation of gross misconduct against the former deputy governor. The House, according to Abdullahi who represents Ajaokuta State Constituency, received, studied and deliberated on the report and a unanimous decision was arrived at to impeach Achuba. He explained that a seven-man committee headed by John Bayeshea submitted the report to the Speaker of the House, Mr Mathew Kolawole, before the lawmakers took the decision. Achuba was sworn in as the deputy governor on February 9, months after he defected to the All Progressives Congress (APC) from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He became the APC’s deputy governorship candidate in the election that brought Yahaya Bello into office after a member of the House of Representatives, Mr James Faleke, rejected to be the governor’s running mate. Years into the Bello’s administration, Achuba was reported to be engulfed in a disagreement with the governor, an issued which escalated with both sides trading blames. In August 2019, Achuba raised an alarm of an alleged threat to his life and accused his principal of intolerance of contrary views.
