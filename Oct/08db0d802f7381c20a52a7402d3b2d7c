Twenty- nine days to the Kogi State governorship election slated for November 16, Catholic Bishops have charged the electorate to vote wisely in order to usher incredible leaders with fear of God who will restore the needed good governance that has eluded the state. According to a pastoral massage to the people of the state, signed by Bishops of Lokoja Diocese, Martins Olorunmolu and his Idah counterparts, Anthony Adaji made available to journalists in Lokoja, the clerics said: “We believe that God loves our dear Kogi State and wants all of us, the people of the state, to live in peace and harmony so as to attain social progress and development under God fearing, capable and honest leaders who will have our welfare at heart “It is unfortunate that the sufferings the people of the state have passed through as a result of bad governance, especially in recent times, the electorates ought to do the needful with the incoming opportunity of electing candidates of their choice come November 16. “As Chief Shepherds, God has given us the responsibility to counsel you on any important social or spiritual matter that affects or will affect your lives significantly in various ways, going by the Scripture saying that the lips of a priest should guard knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.” Read also: Buhari requests Senate to approve N10.069b promissory note for Kogi The Bishops also urged the electorate to be thoughtful, careful and prayerful in electing another set of leaders in Kogi to avert the hardships and painful experience of the past bad leadership that had resulted in delay and irregular payment of workers’ salaries as well as lack of provision of basic infrastructure in the state. However, the clerics noted that attempts are now being made to pay salaries even in small percentages but reminded the people of the damage that have been done before the recent improvement. “We urged the people to see the forthcoming election as a golden opportunity to elect leaders that will make their welfare as priority number one,” they emphasised.
