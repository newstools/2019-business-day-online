With most counters trading at their lowest points in 52 weeks, the analysts expect investors to take advantage and continue to position. “However the direction of the ASI remains positively correlated with movement of market heavyweights (DANGCEM and MTNN), hence trades on them is expected to continue to impact the ASI,” Vetiva added.
