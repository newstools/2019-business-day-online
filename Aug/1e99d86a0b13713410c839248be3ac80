  The National and State Assembly Election Petitions Tribunal sitting in Kaduna on Saturday dismissed the petition of the People’s Democratic Party’s Kaduna Central Senatorial Candidate, Lawal Usman Adamu over his failure to provide concrete evidences to back his claims. Adamu who is popularly known as Mr. LA, had approached the tribunal and asked to be declare winner of the election and nullify the election of Senator Uba Sani of the All Progressives Congress as the senator for Kaduna Central Senatorial District. Chairman of the three-man tribunal, Justice A. H. Suleiman, in a judgment that lasted two hours, said the petitioner had failed to present convincing evidence to be declared winner of the election. One of the counsels to the defendant, Barrister Frank Ikpe, described the judgement as wonderful, after going through an in-depth process and arrived at the conclusion that Senator Uba Sani scored the highest lawful votes to emerge victorious. In his reaction to the judgment, the Chairman of the PDP, Kaduna chapter, Felix Hassan Hyet said the government of APC had succeeded in ridiculing the security agencies and INEC. When asked, if his party, PDP, would appeal the judgement, he said: “We are going to be depending on the advice of our legal team on what to be the next line of action”.
