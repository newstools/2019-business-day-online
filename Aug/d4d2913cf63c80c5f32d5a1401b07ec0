As part of its contributions to Federal Government efforts to boost the agriculture value chain, Leadway Assurance is set to host a breakfast seminar to discuss modern trends in investment and managing risks in the agricultural sector. Themed ‘Using Crowdfunding platforms to invest in Agribusiness’, the one-day seminar is scheduled to hold in Lagos on the 16th of August, 2019 and will draw frontline Agribusiness experts as resource persons. Among the speakers expected at the event are Uka Eje, co-founder/CEO, Thriveagric; Onyeka Akuma, managing director, Farmcrowdy and Ayoola Oluga, co-founder/CEO, Agrecourse. Ayoola Fatona, head, Agric & Micro Insurance, Leadway Assurance and Adetola Adegbayi, executive director, General Insurance, Leadway Assurance are also among the panelists. According to Gboyega Lesi, commercial director, Leadway Assurance, the resolve of Leadway Assurance Company Limited to organise the one-day seminar was driven by its belief that the Agric sector holds so much promise for the nation’s economic revitalisation and thus requires various players from the sub-sectors to collaborate to unearth innovative strategies that could engender growth, development and viability of agribusiness in a manner that mirrors modern global trends. Speaking further on the benefit of the seminar, Lesi noted that sourcing investment and holistic agricultural risk management have remained strong challenges affecting entrepreneurial success in the sector. He added that participants would be better positioned to reap from the business opportunities that have become available as a result of the on-going upside investment in agriculture by the government and the private sector. Leadway Assurance is one of Nigeria’s foremost insurance service companies with a reputation for service efficiency and customer reliability. The organisation is committed to bridging the financial protection gap and increasing the rate of insurance penetration in Nigeria.  Seyi John Salau
