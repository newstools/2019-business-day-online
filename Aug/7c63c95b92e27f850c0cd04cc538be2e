Three of the 38 commissioner and special adviser nominees sent to the Lagos State House of Assembly by Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, have been rejected by the legislators who met on Monday to confirm their nomination. The three nominees are Adekemi Ajayi Bembe, Obafemi George and Olanrewaju Saudi. No official reason was given by the house for rejecting the three nominees, who had earlier been screened by the 16-man committee constituted by the speaker of the house, Mudashiru Obasa. Obasa, who presided over a plenary to confirm the nominees on Monday, said that confirmation was not based on educational qualifications or oratory prowess but on humility and relationship with grassroots. He said that the governor was at liberty to resubmit names of the rejected cabinet nominees.  JOSHUA BASSEY
