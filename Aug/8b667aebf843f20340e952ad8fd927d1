Visions Opticals celebrated its 30th year anniversary of successful business in optical services on Monday, August 19, at its Flagship store, in the Palms Shopping Mall, Oniru, Lagos; marking three decades of existence as the ultimate “Eye Destination”.  The event featured a mini exhibition in the popup eye museum, the “blueroom” which showcased the business timeline from inception, a giant-sized cosmetic retina to the amazement of guests and a whiteroom which housed the most exclusive collections.  Well-wishers and clients-turned-friends who came out to celebrate with the longstanding prestigious eyewear store took mini tours in the museum and proceeded to the store where the directors took time to guide guests on the choice of the best suited and well-designed glasses.  They also went into the experience room for cocktails, canapés and the in-store eyewear high fashion show. The night ended in a climax with the high fashion party which thrilled guests as the runway models strutted in designer collections including Andy Wolf, Linda Farrow, Fendi, Cutler and Gross, Céline and Carrera.
