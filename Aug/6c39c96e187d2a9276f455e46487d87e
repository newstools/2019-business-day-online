The National Working Committee (NWC) of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has bowed to pressure and cleared a governorship aspirant, Babatunde Irukera to contest the Party’s Kogi governorship primaries, holding Thursday. The latest decision of APC may not be unconnected with the protest by the Director-General of Federal Competition and Consumer Protection Commission over his disqualification by the party. Irukera had protested through his supporters under the aegis of Kogi Mandate Group, who besieged the APC National Secretariat, Abuja on Wednesday, carrying placards with various inscriptions such as: ‘APC, learn from Zamfara’, ‘Irukera is our choice’, among others. Amos Alfa, Spokesperson of the Group while addressing journalists, wondered why Irukera was disqualified from the race by the National Working Committee, arguing that he was first cleared. Alfa had threatened that if their request is not granted by the NWC, a decision would be made within the next six hours on the next line of action and moment after the protest the aspirant has been cleared. Lanre Issa-Onilu, APC National Publicity who announced the party’s decision less than the six hours ultimatum issued by Irukera group, said he has met all the conditions stipulated by the party. Issa-Onilu stated that, “Babatunde Ayo Kunle Irukera successfully met the conditions provided by the Party’s guidelines for the nomination of candidates within the time granted to clarify his claims”. Following the clearance of Irukera, 10 aspirants including, Governor Yahaya Bello, Hadiza Iyoma Ibrahim, Yahaya Audu, Sani Lulu Abdullahi, Abubakar Bashir, Danlami Mohammed, Yakubu Mohammed, Hassan Abdullahi and Ekele Aishat Blessing would participate in the Kogi governorship primaries.
