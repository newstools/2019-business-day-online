The Pangolin Conservation Working Group Nigeria (PCWGN) is calling for support from all well-meaning Nigerians for the establishment of a research centre for endangered species in the country. Olajumoke Morenikeji, coordinator, PCWGN said that animals are threatened by habitat destruction and a rising demand for wildlife products that has led to massive poaching and trafficking has drastically reduced the population of endangered species globally. Morenikeji said that the group has created a lot of awareness on pangolins – an endanger specie in Nigeria. “We have rescued, rehabilitated and release some pangolins into protected forest areas in the country,” she said. “The group is now planning a rescue and rehabilitation centre for the pangolin in Nigeria in order to help address the trading and exploitation of this mammal and we are calling for the support of well-meaning Nigerians for this project,” she said. The insatiable appetite for pangolin meat and parts in Africa and Asia, has led scientists to believe that a pangolin is being poached every five minutes, an entirely unsustainable speed, resulting in pangolin species being listed as vulnerable, endangered or critically endangered on the IUCN Red List, the biggest inventory of the world’s threatened animals. The proposed project will sever as a research centre for pangolins and other endangered species to help preserve the population of these animals, she said.  Josephine Okojie
