Abdulkadir Balarabe Musa, a former governor of the old Kaduna State, has thrown his weight behind the several calls for protest in the country. Musa, who spoke in an interview in reaction to the mass protest by Nigerians against government, said that the citizens have constitutional rights to embark on legitimate protest where the Federal Government is failing in its responsibility of providing good governance. According to Musa, the Buhari administration has failed in providing the necessary security, in dealing with security challenges and the poor welfare of Nigerians, just as he said government has no right to arrest anybody protesting on the state of the nation. “It is the fundamental right of the protesters to protest peacefully. The failure of the government is the bane of the call for revolution”, he said. Balarabe, who is the leader of the Conference of Nigerian Political Parties ( CNPP), condemned the arrest of former Presidential Candidate of the African Action Congress ( AAC), Omoyele Sowore for leading # RevolutionNow protest against President Muhammadu Buhari administration, as he called for his immediate release by the Federal Government. “Sowore’s action is not treasonable. You cannot arrest any Nigerian who is protesting against the maladministration of Buhari’s government. The right thing must be done to salvage the country,” he emphasised. He further said that the decision by the government to arrest those they think are threat to them cannot be acceptable. “Nigerians have the right to oppose the wrongs of government and poor handling of the country,” he said.
