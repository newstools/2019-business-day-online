How to Increase Agritourism in Nigeria A research by FN Nnadi and CD Akwiwu recommends that for agro-tourism to contribute to rural development in Nigeria, the national policy on tourism should be reviewed to be trendy with modern tenets. Also, private initiative and involvement in tourism should be encouraged. Nominal compilation of actual and potential agro-tourism sites in the nation should be undertaken in addition to launching extension education campaign on agro-tourism.   Individuals can organize social media campaigns to promote their agritourism business while engaging with those interested on a personal level.
