The Mo Ibrahim Foundation has lauded the establishment of the Transitional Sovereign Council of Sudan, describing it as a significant milestone for the country and Sudanese citizens. With hopes that the peaceful transition to a civilian-led democracy will yield significant developments, the Foundation in a statement noted that democratic civilian rule is the only way to ensure sustainable good governance shared by, and for all the people of Sudan. It enjoined the citizens to embrace the pursuit of an inclusive dialogue between all parties and effective support from the international community for a successful transition. The Mo Ibrahim Foundation also congratulated Abdalla Hamdok on his appointment as the first civilian Prime Minister of Sudan, supporting his vow to prioritise economic prosperity and build a lasting peace across the country. It further recognised Hamdok’s unwavering commitment to upholding standards for leadership and sound governance in Africa. “Sudan is at a critical turning point in its history. What has been achieved is amazing and showcases the ability of a committed civil society, led by women and youth, supported by continental and regional institutions, to achieve a peaceful and democratic transition. We must now all commit to the sustainability of this success, key for the whole continent,” Mo Ibrahim, chair of the Mo Ibrahim Foundation, said in the statement. “I am also happy to see two women as members of the Sovereign Council, including one representative of the Coptic Christian minority. I hope that more young people and women will take an active part in this new government,” he said.  TEMITAYO AYETOTO
