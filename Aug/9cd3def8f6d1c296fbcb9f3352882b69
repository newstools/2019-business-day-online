An agribusiness partnership between Farmcrowdy, a digital agriculture platform, and the Oyo State government has been launched this week, with an investment plan that aims to productively engage an estimated 50,000 farmers. “We promised to explore public-private partnership models to achieve our aim for agriculture,” said Oluwaseyi Makinde, the Oyo state governor, during the launch in Ibadan. “I believe the partnership will be mutually beneficial to Farmcrowdy and the people of our State.” Speaking at the event, Onyeka Akumah, founder of Farmcrowdy said the company is investing in agribusiness in Oyo State within the next three years and connecting no less than 50,000 small scale farmers in the state with solutions to various bottlenecks mitigating against the growth of their farm businesses. “This would surely have a positive impact on their lives and in the end, everyone would be happy with the outcome of the project,” he said. For Kenneth Obiajulu, managing director of Farmcrowdy, the launch is an opportunity to deliver value in the agric value chain in Oyo state, using the company’s model which has enabled it to engage over 25,000 farmers to cultivate 16,000 acres of farmland across 14 states in Nigeria. The Oyo state governor, who in a statement, is described as committed to redefining good governance with a focus on people-centered policies expressed his excitement about the partnership with Farmcrowdy. He explained that the partnership was one of the ways to uphold his promise to expand the economy of Oyo State using agribusiness.  CALEB OJEWALE
