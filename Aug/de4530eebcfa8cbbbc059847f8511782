Artificial Intelligence is expected to transform various industries just as Electricity did over 10 Decades ago and global consulting firm, McKinsey has stated that non-internet sectors like Agriculture, Education, Energy, Logistics & Manufacturing will see a $13 Trillion GDP growth driven by AI by 2030. That’s why The Rise Labs by Rise Networks, Nigeria’s first AI powered Learning, Research and Work Readiness Centre based in Lagos, Nigeria’s commercial capital in partnership with BusinessDay and other Key Private Sector Stakeholders has launched the Nation’s first Artificial Intelligence Ideathon by calling for revolutionary ideas that have the potential of solving Nigeria’s Education, Agriculture, Healthcare and financial inclusion problems using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning models and methodologies. The 2019 AI IDEATHON is open to students, data scientists, working professionals, developers and academics across Nigeria who are passionate about becoming the early pioneers of groundbreaking innovative solutions to the challenges identified above by applying their knowledge and ideas in the realm of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Solutions while encouraging research and collaboration to drive industry-focused AI innovation and the uptake of AI-driven results across sectors. Winners of the Ideathon will get the rare opportunity of a veritable springboard to showcase and share their AI and ML models and applications to a broad community of stakeholders especially Policy Makers, Technology Experts and Organizations, Leaders in the Private Sector and Venture Capitalists to facilitate the scaling and execution of their ideas.
