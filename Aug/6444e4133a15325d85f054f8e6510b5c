In a bid to promote men’s fashion, a French fashion brand for men, Celio, has recently launched a retail store in Abuja, Nigeria’s capital city. The hugely-anticipated launch was a gathering of fashion lovers from across the city of Nigeria who graced the event. There were also lots of breath-taking fabrics and fashion accessories on display as fashion enthusiast gathered amidst an atmosphere of entertainment, networking, not only to feed their eyes, but also shop at the new store. Style influencers present at the event include Kuyet Bamai, Nigerian Fashion Blogger, and Temitope Okunuga, Content Writer, Rage Media, and other fashion lovers. The store is strategically located on the ground floor of the popular Jabbi Lake Mall in the city of Abuja. The growth in Nigeria’s fashion industry has continued to attract global attention, and drawn interest from the international community. Last year, the UK Government expressed interest in the industry, as Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, hosted two of Nigeria’s prominent designers—Eki Orleans and Nkwo Onwuka. In 2010, data on GDP by the National Bureau of Statistics showed that “textile, apparel, and footwear” sector has averaged growth of 17 percent. But Nigeria accounts for 15 percent ($4.7 billion) of Sub-Saharan fashion market which is worth USD31 billion. Celio is a French Men’s Clothing retailer with its headquarter located  in France and has stores in over 50 countries around the world. It was learnt that 70 percent of these shopping centres are located in shopping malls making it easy to access. The Celio Abuja Store is an addition to the two others located in Lagos as the Renowned French Brand continues to grow into the Nigerian Market based on demand. The Celio team also promised to continue to deliver on its promise to provide the best services and products to its customers.
