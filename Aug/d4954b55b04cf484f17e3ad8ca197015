The recent appointment of Leadership of Standing Committees of the House of Representatives revealed that Femi Gbajabiamila has obeyed the command of Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the All Progressive Congress, APC that the ruling party will ‘not share power with the opposition in the House’. This is as the Speaker ostensibly appointed only loyal APC Members as Chairmen of supposed ‘juicy’ Committees and conceded 25 less juicy Committees to the main opposition People’s Democratic Party, PDP and other minority parties members, leaving the majority party with 80 out of the Standing 105 Committees. Recall that Oshiomhole had told House of Representatives members-elect immediately after the general election that APC will not share power with the opposition PDP in the House, even in the headship of Committees. “We will not share power in the House of Representatives and the leadership must ensure that critical Committees that drive government are shared only among APC members. So all the Chairmen of Committees except one that I know it is statutory reserved for opposition which is Public Account, we will have that. “So we will not do the kind of thing that happened the last time in which some APC members as members of the leading party became spectators in the management of the Committees when PDP has majority of strategic Committees. That will not happen in the next Assembly”, Oshiomhole stressed. Juicy Committees in the legislative parlance means those Committees that oversight major government Ministries, Departments and Agencies with huge financial base and influence and carry out critical national assignment such as Appropriation, Constitutional Review, Finance, Foreign Affairs, Agriculture, Education, Defence, Security, Environment, Interior, among others. Consequently, in the 9th House of Representatives, obviously in compliance with the instruction of Oshiomhole, the following ‘juicy’ Committees have been chaired by APC lawmakers whose loyalty to the party is not in doubt. That notwithstanding, the Speaker has insisted that the constitution of the Standing Committees and appointment of their Chairmen is in tandem with his campaign promises to run an all inclusive House where Committees would be chaired or constituted to the ratio of 60:40 between APC and minority parties. Yusuf Gagdi (APC, Plateau), Member of the  House ad- hoc Committee on Media, apparently speaking for Gbajabiamila dismissed insinuations that the Speaker has rescinded on his promise to carry members along irrespective of party affiliations on the leadership of Committees. He stressed that, “21 members of the main opposition People’s Democratic Party and four minority parties’ members have been appointed Chairmen and 30 Deputy Chairmen of Committees”. 1.
