Agroyeilds, a leading agric-tech organisation in Nigeria, has recently launched an online commodity marketplace for investors to invest in the farming activities of smallholder farmers across the country. The investment by investors is meant to help smallholder farmers with the needed finance to expand their operations and move from subsistence to commercial agriculture thereby boosting food production in the country. Agroyields provide market for the farmers by off-taking from them during harvest period. “We recently launched our commodity trading platform to help farmers maximise profit for their labour. Our vision is to boost farmers productivity and ensure that the country attain food security,” said Deborah Adesua Ameli, chief operating officer, Agroyields in an interview with BusinessDay. “For us at Agroyields, we are living our dream which is to reduce hunger and unemployment by supporting smallholder farmers with the provision of funds and training on global best practice while preventing post-harvest losses,” Ameli said. She noted that investors earn a minimum of 24 percent in 9months as returns on their investment, adding that the organisation funds farmers cultivating different crops such as melon, beans, soybeans and groundnut in different parts of the country and off-take from them. Currently, she says the organisation is working with over 100 farmers in Nassarawa and Niger states. According to her, the unique thing about Agroyields is that it does not give cash to farmers but rather provide input and enhance materials. “We believe an innovative national agriculture system, that supports smallholder farmers, would grow the economy and eradicate hunger. That is why we are committed to providing support for smallholder farmers in Nigeria” she said. For any interested investors who want to invest any of the listed crops, should visit the website of the organisation to make the investment.  Josephine Okojie
