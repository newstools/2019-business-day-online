Born Akinlabi Yusuf Lanre, Woofer Wonder is fast becoming a rising force on the streets of Lagos with his music. The bubbling under music star started his music career in 2016 and has now taken his career to the next level with his 2019’ hugely buzzed-about EP ‘Woofer Virus’. On the EP, he combined beautifully sampled beats with his ever melodious rhymes and vocals to provide a quality body-of-work that will not be forgotten anytime soon. All the joints on this studio project have different Afrobeats’ sound.    The EP houses five stellar tracks – the earlier released wave-making joint ‘Padi Padi’, Afropop ‘Kulubodi featuring YBNL protégé Yomi Blaze’, afro-highlife ‘My Girly’, afro-house ‘Bunde’ and his intro-track ‘Say Hello’. The EP features production from the likes of serial hitmaker T-izze TheBeatMaker, Xtra-Pro with guitar instrumental from Allen G. His music style is a fusion of contemporary African pop, highlife, house, hip hop and afro-beat laced with traditional Yoruba melodies. Woofer Wonder is now on our watch list and one to watch out for in the Afrobeats scene.  His new EP ‘Woofer Virus’ is available on all online music stores for your listening pleasure.
