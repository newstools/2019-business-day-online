The Kwara Youths Congress (KYC), an umbrella body of youth associations across the state, has issued a quit notice to Bashiru Bolarinwa, the chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), with a call on him to resign his appointment with immediate effect. Speaking to journalists shortly after an emergency meeting held in Ilorin on Tuesday, the spokesperson of the group, Ibrahim Abdullahi, who read the resolutions of the group, gave the party seven days ultimatum to remove Bolarinwa from office. Ibrahim, who is also the coordinator of Ilorin Emirate Youths Assembly, says: “We have carefully watched the trend of political happenings in the state in the last few days and we hereby lend our voice to corroborate the position of other stakeholders in the state who have earlier called for the party chairman’s removal. “Bolarinwa’s greed, this loyalty attitude to Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq doesn’t portray that of a true party helmsman who is expected to foster prudence, peace, unity and prosperity among members”. “He has demonstrated high level of greed, indiscipline, arrogance and insubordination against the highest ruling class in the state.” He further said: “We are urging him to retrace his steps. Apologise unreservedly immediately to our governor and plead his loyalty to him so that the governor can continue to achieve his God-given aim of re-positioning the state without any unnecessary distraction for within. “It won’t be out of place to state that there is urgent need for the review of the current political arrangement in the state vis-a-vis across party structure.” The group therefore, pledged its unalloyed loyalty and support to the peaceful co-existence of Kwarans especially youths towards national consciousness and democratic advancement.
