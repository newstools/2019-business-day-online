Tizeti, an internet service provider is looking to improve its quality of service with the launch of a 4G LTE network in three states including Rivers, Ogun and Edo. The company said in a statement sent to BusinessDay that it is kicking off in Port Harcourt, the capital of Rivers State with a new solar-powered 4G-capable tower which will enable it to provide first 4G and ISP services in the city. New towers are also planned for Ogun and Edo states. The solar-powered 4G tower may not be unconnected to the inefficient power supply situation in Nigeria which impacts the services of ISPs. Kendall Ananyi, CEO and co-founder said the strategy is also aimed at driving down the cost of operations of the towers, which achieves self-sufficient energy. “We can offer customers unlimited internet at 30 to 50 percent of the cost of traditional mobile data plans,” he said. Tizeti also expects the solar-powered 4G towers to deepen internet penetration in the three states. “Access to affordable and reliable unlimited internet connectivity has been an intractable problem for a lot of Nigerian businesses and residential customers, especially for people in Edo, Rivers and Ogun States. To address this and provide a sustainable and cost-effective solution, we leverage our solar-powered, always-on towers and robust internet bandwidth from MainOne to create a low CAPEX and OPEX network of owned and operated towers,” he said. The price for a Tizeti unlimited plan is N9,500 per month. The company has 1.1 million unique users and internet services that include a new Skype-like personal and business enterprise communications service – WiFiCall.ng and access to video streaming sites such as YouTube, Netflix, and Iroko.
