President Muhammadu Buhari has ordered investigation into the heinous murder of Achejuh Abuh, Woman Leader of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Wada/Aro campaign council, in the just concluded gubernatorial election in Kogi State. The investigation is coming exactly one week after the gruesome murder which has received widespread condemnations across Nigeria The President, in a statement signed by his Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, decried whatever could spur anyone to take the life of another human being, particularly a woman, who was burnt to death in her home in the most gruesome manner. President Buhari has therefore charged all security agencies involved in the investigation to do a thorough and expeditious job on the matter, so that justice could be served without fear or favor. “We must learn to behave decently, whether during elections or at other times. No life should be taken wantonly under any guise, and the fact that this reprehensible act occurred two days after voting shows primitive behavior, which should not be accepted in a decent society,” the President said. The President, while sympathizing with the family of the deceased, vowed that the law would catch up with the malefactors, and justice would be done. Any descent to barbarism, as was visited on the PDP Woman Leader, President Buhari said, has gone out of the realm of politics, and is pure criminality and bestiality. “Such evildoers must be brought to justice, irrespective of whatever allegiances they hold,” the President affirmed. It will be recalled that late Abuh was killed in one of the most gruesome post-election attacks in her resident by people alleged to be celebrating the victory of Governor Yahaya Bello minutes after the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC announced the Kogi gubernatorial election result last Monday.
