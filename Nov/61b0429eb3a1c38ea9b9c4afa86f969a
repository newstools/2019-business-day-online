Governor Henry Seriake Dickson has assured the people of Sagbama Local Government Area that only the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) has the structure to emerge victorious in the forthcoming November 16 governorship election in Bayelsa State. Dickson led the PDP governorship campaign for the second time on Thursday in his local government area, urging the people not to be deceived by promises made by the opposition All Progressives Congress (APC), saying it lacks the structure to win the election. Although the governor was absent when the party and its flag bearer, Douye Diri campaigned in Brass, Ogbia and Southern Ijaw Local Government Areas, he promised to lead the remaining campaigns. The PDP campaign stopped at Ebedebiri in Constituency 1, Sagbama in Constituency 2 and Agbere in Constituency 3 as speaker after speaker rallied the people to vote the PDP as it has offered so much to the Ijaw people. Dickson alleged that the APC has nothing to offer the people and was only prepared to rig its way to victory and enjoined the people to vote for the PDP and also defend their votes. Douye Diri, the PDP governorship candidate, assured that he would consolidate on the gains of the Dickson administration if he emerged governor and urged the people for massive support to win the election. Other speakers including the Director-General of the campaign, Nimibofa Ayawei, members representing the three constituencies in the House of Assembly, students and youth groups also called for massive support for Diri. In a related development, the state chapter of Hope Democratic Party has gone to court to stop the November 16 governorship election, saying a case it instituted in 2016 over the omission of its candidate from the ballot paper for the 2015 governorship election was yet to be discharged. In 2016, Hope Democratic Party had taken the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to court, asking the court to cancel the election over the omission of the party’s candidate from the ballot paper.
