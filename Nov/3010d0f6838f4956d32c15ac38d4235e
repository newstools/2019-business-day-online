Nigeria’s stock market closed negative (-0.37percent) on Wednesday, thereby reversing the previous day’s record gains. This southward close was fueled by investors’ decisions to take profit in stocks like Total Nigeria Plc, Dangote Cement Plc, Unilever Nigeria Plc, GTBank Plc and that of PZ Cussons Plc. The value of listed equities stood at N12.821trillion from a preceding day high of N12.878trillion, representing a decline of N57billion. “The performance of the ASI can be largely attributed to the decline in market heavyweight (Dangote Cement) as well as profit taking by investors in some of the counter that rallied in recent session. “However, with an increase in transaction sizes in recent sessions and continued buy interest in banking stocks, we expect the ASI to return to the positive side on Thursday in the absence of sell offs in heavyweight stocks”, said market analysts at Lagos-based Vetiva Securities. The NSE All Share Index (NSE) which opened at 26,456.39 points decreased to 26,339.11 points at the sound of the trade closing gong. In 5,031 deals, equity dealers exchanged 610,575,893 units valued at N11.104billion.
