While the former National Secretary, Mai-Mala Buni was elected Governor of Yobe State, the former National Deputy Chairman (South), Niyi Adebayo has been appointed Minister and the National Auditor, George Moghalu was recently made Managing Director of the National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA). An official of the party who do not want to be mentioned confirmed to BusinessDay that the replacement of these National Officers would be main agenda at the NEC holding this Friday after a Caucus meeting on Thursday. The source said, normally a mini convention is supposed to be held to elect new officers into the vacant offices but from all indications, the Zonal caucuses of where the positions were zoned have been asked to bring a consensus candidate to the NEC for ratification. “At there zoning level, they will not bring two names. The North East, South West and South East where there are vacancies they have decided who will replace Adebayo, Buni and Moghalu”, he stated.  James Kwen, Abuja
