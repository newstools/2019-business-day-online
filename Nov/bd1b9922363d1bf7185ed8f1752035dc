Few days to the gubernatorial election in Kogi State, Musa Wada, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) standard bearer, has promised to govern the state with the fear of God if given the mandate. Wada made the pledge during a campaign rally at Kabba, saying that fairness, justice and equity would be his guiding principle and not religion and tribalism. He assured that each part of the state will be treated equally and fairly in the distribution of appointments and amenities. The candidate appealed to the people not to despair about the present sorry state of things in the state, saying that their joy and happiness will be restored under his administration. He equally emphasised that  payment of salary and pensions will become regular under the PDP administration as from January 2020, adding that the state was blessed with abundant solid mineral resources, arable land for agriculture and quality   human resources, pointing out that they will be harnessed to create prosperity for the people. Wada also promised to initiate discussions with foreign and local investors on how some of the solid mineral deposits can be developed to create jobs and wealth for the citizens. Wada explained that the present widespread of poverty and squalor in communities across the state was an embarrassment to well-meaning indigenes, promising to reverse the ugly situation. He promised to embark on massive infrastructural development across the state and develop the education sector from primary, secondary to tertiary level to give the state a better future. “My administration will also look into the possibility of upgrading the College of Agriculture to a full-fledged University,” he said. Wada frowned at the deplorable state of Kabba township roads and pledged to repair them alongside others in major towns in Okunland.
