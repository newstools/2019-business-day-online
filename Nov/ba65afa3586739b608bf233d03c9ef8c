The programme was a first of its kind with the participants anxious for more exposure to the capital market.  A similar engagement was held in Lagos in October, with equal success recorded”, Uduk noted. In his remarks, the Chairman of the SEC Board,   Olufemi Lijadu noted that Capital Markets play critical roles in the development of any country, adding that it could be a medium to raise more funds to finance the nation’s development projects in a period of low oil price. “What we do here at this CMC meeting has far greater implications for the economy. We hope and trust that this will be the beginning of good partnership between the SEC Board and the market as we both have a common objective of developing a first class capital market”, Lijadu added. He said, “We hope to build a capital market where there is transparency, fairness, liquidity, compliance among others. A lot of the knowledge and research capability you have as stakeholders will be of immense assistance to us as we pursue these laudable goals to make our market a world class capital market”.
