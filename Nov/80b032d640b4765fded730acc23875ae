The Joint Action Civil Society Coalition has expressed deep concern over what it described as a trajectory of violence and the tilt towards anarchy in the upcoming gubernatorial elections in Bayelsa and Kogi states. They raised the alarm over impending violence in the elections while recalling that the February and March general elections resulted in the loss of atleast 521 lives. The group in a statement Signed by Tosin Gbolasere and Chikanne Ezigbo and issued on Friday said despite the appreciable security deployments in the states, the violence has persisted and is spiralling out of control. â€œBarely 24 hours to the gubernatorial elections, reports of arson, and the death of at least four citizens in Bayelsa state; and several episodes of violent clashes between political rivals, with each side accusing the other of deploying armed thugs to sabotage the elections in both states. They expressed concern that the context painted raises certain concerns of ongoing violence leading to the run-up of the elections which may deter the participation of electorates in fulfilling their civic rights as tensions heighten. The group therefore called on the Federal Government to live up to its primary responsibility of protecting lives and property and promoting the welfare of all who live in Nigeria by ensuring maximum security of electorates and observers. They also urged the government to take clear and measurable steps to end the impunity that has trailed electoral violence by ordering for a full investigation to expose and bring the perpetrators of electoral violence to justice.
