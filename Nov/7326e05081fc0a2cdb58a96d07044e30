In commemoration of the 2019 World Food Day, Sannikayz Kitchen has fed over 1,000 children in Lagos and Abuja through its ‘Feed the Kids Initiative’. The Feed the kids’ initiative develops and empowers children by providing nutritional meals, snacks, liquids and values enabling them to dream thereby restoring their reason for life and a sustainable future. Sanni Sheriff, founder of Sannikayz Kitchen said the annual celebration is spearheaded by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is about raising awareness on issues related to food such as poverty and hunger. Sheriff stressed the need for collective efforts in not only increasing food production but paying adequate attention to the quality of food being produced. Similarly, he added that there must be collaboration between the public and private sectors to tackle issues of malnutrition and hunger in the country, especially among children. “Feed the Kids also decided to take part in this global event in 2 major cities- Lagos and Abuja. We were able to touch lives of over a thousand children by sharing food, water, fruits, vegetable salad, and snacks,” he said. “Special thanks to all our sponsors, donors and our formidable team of volunteers,” Sheriff said. “In 10 months we have done over 8,000 distributions of food and we hope to reach our annual goal of 10,000 distributions of food at the end of the year,” he added.
