David Fuoh, member representing Sardauna, Gashaka and Kurmi Federal Constituency in the House of Representatives, has called on the opposition APC in Taraba to accept the verdict of the appeal court affirming Governor Darius Ishaku of Taraba as the winner of the governorship election in the state. Fuoh made the call on Tuesday while reacting to the court of appeal’s judgment upholding the judgment of the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal which earlier affirmed Ishaku as the winner of the March 9 governorship election in the state. Recall that the All Progressives Congress (APC) had appealed the earlier judgment by the Governorship Election Petition Tribunal at the Court of Appeal in Abuja. The Federal Court of Appeal, Abuja Division, led by Justice Chidi Nwanna on Monday dismissed the appeal on the ground that APC’s candidate, Sani Danladi was disqualified for the contest, hence the party did not field a candidate for the said election. Fuoh said that the judgment by the appellate court was a justification for the aspirations of the Taraba masses who voted massively for Ishaku for the consolidation of his landmark achievements in the state. The legislature said that the judgment had further rekindled the hope and aspirations of the common masses of Taraba. He commended the judiciary for rising to the occasion by giving hope to the common man. He appealed to the governor to extend his hand of fellowship to the oposition APC, and to take the judgment as victory for Tarabans in general. Fuoh also called on the opposition to join hands with Ishaku to move the state forward and avoid distracting the governor to settle down for work.  Nathaniel Gbaoron, Jalingo
