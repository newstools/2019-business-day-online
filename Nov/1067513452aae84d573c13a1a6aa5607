Nigeria’s apex court, the Supreme Court, has said the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and its presidential candidate in the 2019 presidential election, Atiku Abubakar, failed to provide sufficient evidence to back up their claim that the Independent National Electoral Commission  (INEC) had a sever to which election results were transmitted.  The Court stated this on Friday, while giving reasons for dismissing Atiku’s appeal against President Muhammadu Buhari’s victory . Buhari was the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the election.  The Court said that the petitioner was wrong to have relied on results from a website which could not be verified.
