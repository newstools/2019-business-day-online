Speaking about the strong and inspirational bond between Lady Maiden Ibru and her husband, Alex Ibru, Ogundele has this to say; ‘I will never forget the beautiful story of love and loyalty between you and the late chief Alex Ibru, who laid the foundations, which you have transformed into Nigeria’s No.1 Print Establishment!” The statement reads in part “with an empire as huge as the Ibru’s dynasty, you have displayed great leadership characteristics and a rare winning mentality.
