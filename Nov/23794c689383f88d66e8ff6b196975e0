“First Bank of Nigeria Limited partnered Linda Ikeji TV for the broadcast of the TV programme, First Class Material because apart telling our story as a country, First-Class Material also aims to make education, vocational training and skill acquisition trendy, attractive and fashionable to the nation’s human capital by celebrating and rewarding exceptional Nigerians that have made an indelible mark in their chosen endeavor, irrespective of where they are, thereby inspiring the next generation”, she said. She explained that the reason for the partnership with Linda Ikeji Television was informed by the need to make the programme become a wider dream, as television is tailored to such an idea. While urging the government, individuals and corporate organisations to emulate the idea, Ani-mumuney said, there are lots of talents in the country waiting to be celebrated. Explaining the reason behind the project, Linda Ikeji explained that she was moved by the negative narratives being spread about Nigeria, saying in spite of the challenges the nation is going through, there are lots of First Class Materials among Nigerians. Ikeji explained further that the initiative focuses on Nigerians who have performed incredibly well, adding that it targets 200 people across board to select the best among them for profiling.
