He pointed out that there was the need to train people in new agricultural technologies to enhance food production, adding that the Rural Employment Promotion (REP) department of the directorate would through the programme engage the people in more susceptible agricultural training. He noted that the nation-wide programme was intended to boost the productivity of smallholder farmers in rural communities in order to reduce hunger and improve their livelihood.
