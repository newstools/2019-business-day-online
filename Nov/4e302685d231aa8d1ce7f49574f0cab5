The wholesale business unit (WBU) of MTN Nigeria has emerged as the best performing units among its three business units at the end of the third quarter ended September 30, 2019. WBU recorded 98 percent gross margin, indicating that MTN Nigeria retained virtually every revenue it earned from this segment of its business. The other business units are Consumer Business Unit (CBU) and Enterprise Business Unit (EBU). Appraising its unaudited third quarter financial statements for the period ended September 30, 2019, MTN Nigeria generated N29.9 billion revenue from the WBU, and less of direct costs of N747.5 million, the unit ended the period with a gross profit of N29.15 billion. This amounted to 98 percent gross margin. The WBU revenue grew by 35 percent when compared with N22.20 billion realised in the third quarter of 2018. In addition, both the direct costs and gross profit of this line of business grew by 35 percent when compared with direct costs and gross profit made in corresponding in 2018. In both the third quarters of 2018 and 2019, the gross margin for the WBU remained at 98 percent. The consumer business unit (CBU) accounted for the bulk of the revenue as at the end of the third quarter as MTN Nigeria earned N723.7 billion revenue from the CBU, but with N150.9 billion as direct costs, the CBU made N572.8 billion as gross profit at the end of the third quarter 2019. Compared with 2018, the CBU generated N662.3 billion as revenue; N125.6 billion as direct costs while the gross profit stood at N536.6 billion. This implies a gross margin of 81 percent. The implication is that CBU witnessed the least growth in revenue and gross profit among the three business segments. Apart from that, its gross margin declined from 81 percent  last year September to 79 percent in September 2019. Similarly, the share of CBU’s revenue fell to 84 percent this year from 87 percent in September 2018. The Enterprise Business Unit (EBU) posted the second best performance after WBU. At the end of the third quarter of 2019, EBU recorded a 29 percent growth in revenue which moved from N79.99 billion last year September to N102.85 billion as at September 2019.
