Union Homes Real Estate Investment Trust announced a net asset value (NAV) of N9.79 billion for October 2019, the notice released to the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) indicated. This represents a decline of 2.4 percent when compared with N10.04 billion NAV it announced for September 2019. The implication is that its NAV has shed N243.73 million in 30 days. In both September and October 2019, Union Homes REIT had nine properties and delinquency rates at 0.60 percent in both periods, while the number of units of houses, yields, tenancy structures and occupancy rates remained the same. Interestingly, the construction sub sector grew by 2.37 percent at the end of the third quarter of 2019 as against 0.67 percent and 3.18 percent at the end of the second and first quarters of 2019 respectively, the recent GDP figures announced by the nation’s data agency, the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) indicated.

The Savannah Court has fourteen blocks of flats and has been in existence for eight years, its current yield is at 4.18 percent with 93 percent occupancy rate. “Something unique must have happened for the decline in its NAV within 30 days since other parameters remained the same. However, the general business environment is not favourable to players in the real estate sector”, a senior analyst who pleaded anonymity, said. The seven years old Contemporary Apartment in Ikoyi is occupied by individuals, and has four blocks of flats, and having its occupancy rate at 100 percent. Its current yield is 4.49 percent.
