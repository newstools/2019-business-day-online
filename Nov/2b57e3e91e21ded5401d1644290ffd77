The Action Democratic Party (ADP) has called on the Federal Government to complete the Ajaokuta Steel Company in Kogi State, saying that the current blame game over the completion of the project should end. The party stated this in a statement signed by its national chairman, Sanni Yabagi, a copy of which was made available to Businessday, Tuesday, noting that its position was in reaction to a visit to the company by the Minister for Mines and Steel development, Olamilekan Adegbite. Yabagi lamented that despite exorbitant amount of money spent on the project since 1976, it has not been able to produce a single steel rod for local consumption not to talk of export. The party said that the Ajaokuta Steel Company, as a public asset, was capable of generating about a million jobs for the nation’s teeming unemployed youths in the host state and across the country, if developed to a stage of real production.

The party further urged President Muhammadu Buhari to give all the deserved attention to the economic development of Nigeria because it was his primary responsibility to all Nigerians. “Ajaokuta in particular has been at about 90percent of completion for several years, with no one making effort to get it to start production of iron and liquid steel for local consumption and export.
