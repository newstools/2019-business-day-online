The Kwara state government and AgroNigeria have collaborated to hold the ‘Farm2Fork Dialogue’ to fashion modalities to address issues limiting the sector. The event with the theme ‘Eliminating the Impediments to a Prosperous Commodity Agribusiness’ is scheduled to hold on the 3rd and 4th of December, 2019 at the main auditorium of government house, Ilorin, Kwara State. Richard Mark-Mbaram, co-convener of the Dialogue and CEO of Agro Nigeria said the dialogue conference is imperative to facilitate the needed solutions to challenges bedeviling agribusiness in the country. The event which is also being organised in conjunction with the National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industries Mines & Agriculture (NACCIMA), Organised Private Sector Exporters Association (OPEXA), and the Federation of Agriculture Commodity Associations of Nigeria (FACAN), will among other things leverage on the positive momentum generated by recent economic actions of the government with a view to ensure that the Nigerian economy and its critical stakeholders benefit thereof. “The dialogue will hinge on the key narrative that the Nigerian private sector in agriculture is keen on fostering a Proactive Partnership for Prosperity (PPP) with the public sector,” Mark-Mbaram said. “Right from local production to processing, logistics, consumption, and exports, there exists cross-cutting challenges which can only be comprehensively addressed by having all stakeholders around the table,” he further said. “This is what the Farm2Fork Dialogue seeks to achieve. In essence, the dialogue is designed not only to interrogate the causative issues resulting in the current reality of agro-commodity deficits in the country but to evolve a trajectory for short-medium and long-term solutions – this premised on an inclusive template”, he added.
