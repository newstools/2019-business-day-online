The Bridge, Africa’s number one financial literacy by Businessday, in the finale of its second season, features Nnenna Jacob Ogogo, Head of Women in Business Desk, at First City Monument Bank. In this episode, Ogogo speaks about FCMB’s passion for promoting women-owned businesses, and FCMB’s Women in Business desk, where women-owned businesses are empowered with tools to help them scale their operations. According to statistics, 48% percent of SMEs in Nigeria are owned by women and only 17% of these businesses are supported by Nigerian banks. These businesses are not properly structured. Their owners lack the basic tools and knowledge to make these businesses truly profitable. FCMB is bridging this gap by providing access to finance, capacity building and access to knowledge. The Bank has trained over a thousand female owned businesses on various business strategies and is planning to reach more by creating a free virtual training platform online. Apart from providing business training, FCMB is also providing special zero interest loans to about 40 to 50 female business owners. This loan comes with training on the best way to utilize them. The women in Business Desk at FCMB also provides opportunities to network. The desk brings together various female business owners equips them with tools to help them network better.
