 Justice Aminu Aliyu of the Federal High Court, Minna, on Monday, May 27, 2019, ordered the Commissioner of Police, Niger State Command, to arrest former Niger State Governor Muazu Babagida Aliyu and compel his appearance in court on June 13, 2019. The Judge also directed the Commissioner of Police to arrest former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate for Niger State, Umar Nasko, a statement issued on Monday by the Acting Head of Media and Publicity of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Tony Orilade said. The development was sequel to the non-appearance of the duo in court for the second time. The EFCC is prosecuting Aliyu and Nasko over their alleged involvement in about N2billion money laundering. The judge, who was visibly angry over lack of respect for his court, gave three orders to the Commissioner of Police for failure to carry out his order. First, he ordered Commissioner of police to appear before the court for failure to execute his order. Secondly, he directed the Commissioner of Police to execute the Bench warrant earlier issued against the duo. The Judge further directed the CP to personally arrest Aliyu and Nasko and personally bring them to court on the next adjourned date- June 13, 2019. Incidentally, no reason was canvassed for their absence in court. Lawyer to Babangida Aliyu, Akinjide Ayodele (SAN), who was present in court, however, claimed that he was unable to get in touch with his client on Sunday. But the judge replied that Babangida Aliyu was not in court according to his court records. Nasko’s lawyer, Mamman Ousman (SAN), was also absent in court with his client. Lead lawyer to the prosecuting EFCC, Muyiwa Akinboro (SAN), Hadiza Afegbua and Bilyaman Lawal appeared for the Commission, the statement added.
