The agency responsible for regulating shipping, maritime labour and coastal waters, the Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency (NIMASA) has announced plans to put in place structures that will explore more opportunities in the renewable energy space which may lead to less activities in crude oil exploration and exploitation in the country. While delivering a paper with the theme, “The effect of global energy transformation” at one of the side workshops during the just concluded Offshore Technology Conference, OTC in Houston Texas, Director General of NIMASA Dakuku Peterside emphasized its readiness to develop policies that will see to a smooth transition from the regime of intense wet cargo operations, to the inevitable era of renewable energy. “We at NIMASA are working to create a new framework to maximize opportunities provided by renewable energy. So the world does not leave us behind,” Peterside said at the event. The DG at NIMASA said the regulatory body is taking conscious steps to put the necessary building blocks for an era of renewable energy when exploration and exploitation of oil and gas and all associated logistics will no longer play a major role. “We propose policies to promote transition to clean and renewable energy. We have accepted the inevitability of renewable energy in years to come” Peterside noted.
