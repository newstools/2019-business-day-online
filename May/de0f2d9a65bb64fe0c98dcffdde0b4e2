The Africa Business Process Outsourcing industry got another boost as a major player in that space, Outsource Global, recently announced their expansion into Japan, in line with its strategic growth plan. Speaking from Japan at the recently concluded Japan IT Week, Amal Hassan, founder/ CEO of Outsource Global, said, “We are particularly excited about this strategic expansion. It not only allows us to serve the Japanese market, it is also an entry point for us to provide a full range of outsourced services
to the Asian market”. “We are also thankful to ITC She Trades for facilitating our participation at the Japan IT Week thereby giving us the platform to have these strategic conversations.” Asia is the world’s fastest growing economic region, with an estimated annual GDP growth of 5.7 percent. Within that region, Japan is the second best economy by GDP growth and
third wealthiest in terms of GDP per capita. “With Japan being the 23rd wealthiest nation in the world, and home to global automobile giants we are confident of our capability to serve this new market. Our over 800 agents are
spread across three locations in Nigeria and our facilities have the capacity to cater for over 2,000 remote teams who can work with organisations around the world,” Nusaibah Kofar-Naisa, the COO of Outsource Global, said. The company’s participation at the Japan IT Week was sponsored by SheTrades, an initiative of the International Trade Centre, with a mandate to connect three million women owned businesses to international markets by 2021. Outsource Global is one of the biggest and leading Africa business and knowledge process outsourcing firms based in Nigeria. Their recent expansion to Japan comes on the heels of
the earlier announcement of their expansion to the UK where they will provide outsourced data
training, software development, telesales and marketing as well as remote professional services to leading organisations across the world.
