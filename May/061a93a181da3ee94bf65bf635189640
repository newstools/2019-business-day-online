President Muhammadu Buhari is presently presiding over the last Federal Executive Council meeting under the current dispensation that will consider and approve projects for execution. BusinessDay checks revealed that 17 different Memos have been listed for consideration at Wednesday’s FEC meeting with infrastructure development topping the agenda. Many representatives of the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) of government were seen waiting patiently to be called to defend their submissions. Minister of Information and Culture three weeks ago disclosed that the last FEC meeting which comes up on the 22nd of May will be the valedictory FEC. BusinessDay gathered that today’s FEC will be the last under which memos generated by the current cabinet members will be considered. About 27 memos were considered during the last FEC meeting which lasted for almost 12 hours, as the President began winding down of activities, ahead of the May 29th inauguration which is expected to be a low key celebration. “There are 17 memos listed for today’s consideration because as you know, this is the last FEC that will consider memos. Next week’s FEC will be simply valedictory and no memos will be discussed,” one Villa Source revealed.
