Former Vice President and Presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the last election, Atiku Abubakar has hailed the appointment of Kaycee Madu, a Nigerian, who was first elected as a Member of Parliament in Alberta, Canada, and has subsequently been appointed Minister for Municipal Affairs. Atiku in a statement he personally signed and made available to BusinessDay through his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, noted that for Nigerians to prosper in Nigeria, and around the world, has always been the cornerstone of his vision, the “Atiku Plan.” “Upward mobility and local and international successes, of the type displayed by Mr. Madu, go a long way in changing the international narrative of Nigeria, which, in recent years, has suffered some challenges. “Even more importantly, we must highlight the role education played in preparing Mr. Madu for the spotlight. As I have said previously, education is the single investment that yields the biggest dividend. I should know, I have put my money where my mouth is. “The more Nigeria invests in education, the more our people will become beacons of light, both locally and internationally. “Today I celebrate Mr. Madu’s achievements. I am proud of you and will do all within my power to ensure that many Ahmadus, Gbengas and Emekas, follow in your footsteps,” Atiku added.  Innocent Odoh, Abuja
