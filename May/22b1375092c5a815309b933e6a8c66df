It was a blissful evening characterized by amazing cocktails, candies, snacks and music at Wande Coal’s edition of TRACE Live as guests trooped into Terra Kulture on Wednesday to experience the vocal gem perform carefully selected tunes from his catalogue. Wande who was at home on the stage brought a combination of excitement and nostalgia as he opened the show with hits off his Mushin2Mo-Hits album from a decade ago which got the crowd up on feet. He kept the audience in a dancing frenzy all through the show and they were only able to rest for a few minutes when he paused to share stories about his journey to stardom. In the storytelling bit of his performance, Wande left no stone unturned; First, as a spontaneous singer from his undergraduate days in The University of Lagos; then as a Back-up dancer for famous Nigerian artiste-KONGA; and ultimately his meeting with the duo of Don Jazzy and Dbanj of the now defunct Mo-hits Record whom he performed “OLOLUFE” to for the first time in his singing career. Like a true Vocal Gem, Wande superseded expectations in a laid back, yet admirable manner as he delivered a spectacle of a show with the support of his highly-entertaining band and younger brother T-Josh as his back-up singer; they mesmerized the audience with Wande Coal’s All-time favorite tunes. Songs such as Born D Maga, Ololufe, Rotate, Shey Na like this, The Kick, Isskaba, Baby Hello, Ahismapayin, Gentility amongst others caught the audience spell-bound. Notable guests in attendance included Charles Aigbe of Fidelity Bank, Orezi, Lynxx, Harrysong, Reekado Banks, Skiibii, Mayorkun, Dj Spinall Moweezy, Obi Aiska, Deji Awokoya of Beat FM, Bizzle Osikoya, Asa Asika and a host of many others.
