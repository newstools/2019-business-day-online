Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has certified CWG Plc as meter service provider adding credence to its position  to enhance services in Nigeria’s rural electrification  project. This certification puts CWG Plc on a global map of the few certified metering solutions experts in Nigeria that will provide services to IBDC. Just two weeks ago, the NERC gave approval to CWG as a Meter Asset Provider (MAP) for IBEDC. CWG came top among the 7 approved MAP Vendors for Ibadan Electric. This was a competitive process involving over 120 MAPs licensee out of which CWG was certified and approved among the 30 MAPs for engagement with the Discos in Nigeria. These milestones are due to the collaborative effort of the CWG Utility Team, led by Daniel Shoban-Das, vice president, Corporate Development, CWG, the company management said. “This breakthrough avails us the opportunity to be part of the major drivers of NERC’s vision in eliminating estimated billing and cover the metering gaps of over 5m within the electricity supply value chain in Nigeria”, the company said. Meanwhile, the company was recently invited to  be part of the Mini grid initiative of the Federal Government financed by the World Bank. A preliminary expository discussion of the project held between April 1-3rd and was attended by Daniel Shoban-Das and Emmanuel Ilori, business development manager, CWG,  in a bid to understand the basic expectations of the partnering entities on the initiative that is set to light up 250 communities off the National Grip.
