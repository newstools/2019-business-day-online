Liverpool may have finished second in the Premier League, but they still took home the biggest money from TV income and prize money in the competition, according to a UK’s Nick Harris’ estimates of how much each Premier League clubs earned this season. Each team takes home an equal share of £79.4million, while the rest is divided depending on the final league position and the number of televised matches. There is a minimum for TV income, set at £12.3million for hosting up to 10 games, with clubs earning an extra £1.1million on top of that for every other match televised. Prize money is awarded per league position, with each side earning £1.9million for every place they finish above bottom. In 2018, profits outside the top 6 related predominately to an ability to keep costs down, while a couple of clubs also benefitted from relatively sizeable commercial and matchday revenue. The vast majority of profits were due to clubs recording large profits on players sales after several high-profile players departed the Premier League. Liverpool benefitted hugely from a run to the Champions League Final and a great Premier League campaign. Here is a broken down of each club’s earnings for the 2018-19 campaign, not including revenue from European and cup games, ranking them in order of how much they accrued over the season.

With the final positions known, Liverpool is likely to earn more from TV income in 2019/20 season under new TV deal, the ratio from top to bottom will also see a marginal increase. The topside will still be among the big earners: a case study of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.  Anthony Nlebem
