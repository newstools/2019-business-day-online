The Enugu State government in a swift move to avert any plan to downgrade or shut the airport, said it will comply with directive of the Ministry of aviation.  Hadi Sirika, minister of State, Aviation, had on Friday disclosed government’s plan at downgrading the Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Enugu or shut it down to enable it carry out renovations on the airport runways to avoid any major incident.  However, while responding to the Enugu State government’s plans to comply with safety rules, Sirika called for a speedy implementation of the directive stating that it would help government address the safety concerns on that airport’s runway.  The Minister who was commissioning facilities around the Murtala Muhammed Airport Lagos acknowledged steps being taken by the Enugu State government in an effort to improve safety at the Akanu Ibiam international Airport (Enugu).  “We are happy to see that the Enugu state government has seen reason with the Ministry to address safety concerns raised.  “We are appreciative that in the name of safety, Enugu State Executive Council approved the immediate closure of Orie Emene Market (abattoir inclusive) to forestall any tragedy at the Airport,” the minister said.  “We are also happy that the Council also ordered immediate removal of all illegal structures encroaching on the land of the Airport, radio mast of the state broadcasting service, and Free Trade Zone,” he added.  “We, however, would be extremely comfortable if compliance with the above directives from the state government are carried out as soon as possible to give us necessary allowance to carry out repairs as well as expansion and extension of the Runway. All these will better the lot of the Enugu Airport and improve safety a hundred fold,” he said.  Ifeoma Okeke
