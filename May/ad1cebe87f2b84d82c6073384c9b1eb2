Justice Olarenwaju Mabekoje of the Ogun State High Court sitting in Abeokuta, Ogun State, on Friday, May 17, 2019, dismissed the no- case submission filed by a former governor of Ogun State, Otunba Gbenga Daniel, who is being prosecuted for an alleged N200m (Two Hundred Million Naira) fraud. The defendant, according to a statement issued on Friday by the Acting Head of Media and Publicity of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) Tony Orilade, was re-arraigned on Monday, April 16, 2012 by the EFCC, on a 32-count charge bordering on misappropriation of funds to the tune of over N200 million, criminal breach of trust and abuse of office. He pleaded not guilty to the charge preferred against him, thereby setting the stage for his trial. The defendant, at the last sitting, filed a no-case submission. At the resumed hearing today, Justice Mabekoje, in his ruling, ordered the defendant to enter his defence in respect of 18 of the counts. The Judge, in his further ruling, however, discharged the defendant in respect of 14 counts. Justice Mabekoje adjourned further hearing in the case to July 4, 5, 2019, the statement added.
