President Muhammadu Buhari was conspicuously absent on Wednesday from the State Banquet organized as part of event marking the inauguration of the President and Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. The President who was expected to host the invited guests failed to show up at the event but was represented by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. Many of the dignitaries, including members of the Diplomatic Corps, who had looked forward to having dinner with the President were however disappointed to see that it was only the Vice President that showed up for the event. Secretary to the Government of the Federation, Boss Mustapha while welcoming the guests and top party officials, asked them to keep faith with the President and his team as they move the country to the “ Next Level” No official reason was advanced for the President’s absence at the event that also attracted the Chairman of the All Progressive Congress APC, Adams Oshiomhole and Governors of Kogi and Edo states, Yahaya Bello and Godwin Obaseki , respectively.
