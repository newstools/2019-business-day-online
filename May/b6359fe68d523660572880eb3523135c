President Muhammadu Buhari arrived Abuja on Sunday after a ten- day private visit to the United Kingdom. President Buhari, who was looking agile and fit, stepped down from the aircraft at the Presidential wing of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International airport at 6.24Pm He is expected to receive the President of the United Nations General Assembly (PGA) Maria Espinosa, on Monday. The visit will be the first official assignment the President will be performing after a ten day rest in the UK. Espinosa will be paying a one-day official visit to Nigeria on Monday, according to information from her Spokesperson, Monica Gravley. The President of the UN General Assembly is also expected to meet with students of the University of Abuja where she will deliver a speech on “the role of multilateralism and how to respond to global challenges in a fast-changing world.” She will later meet with UN officials in the country and take part in a discussion with women on their role in promoting multilateralism, which seeks to bind powerful nations, discourage unilateralism (one-sided action) and give small powers a voice and influence they could not otherwise exercise.
