Real Madrid have reportedly completed the signing of Eintracht Frankfurt striker Luka Jovic for £52.4million, as reported by Sky in Germany. Jovic has been hugely impressive on loan at Eintracht Frankfurt this season, with the German club having recently exercised an option to sign him permanently from Benfica this summer. Real are now set to bring in Jovic on a five-year contract as they look to bolster their resources as part of a summer rebuild. Frankfurt will pay Benfica around £10.5m of the transfer fee, as reported by Sky Sports. Jovic has been excellent this season – he has scored 27 goals in 47 appearances in all competitions, and helped Frankfurt to reach the semi-finals of the Europa League. Having performed to such a high standard, Jovic is also being monitored by Premier League champions Manchester City. However, it seems that the Serbia international is set for Real, who are determined to improve upon a campaign that sees them 18 points adrift of leaders Barcelona going into the final day of the campaign. After starting out at Red Star Belgrade, Jovic joined Benfica in 2016 but played just four times for the Portuguese club before heading to Frankfurt on a two-year loan deal. Frankfurt still have two Bundesliga fixtures remaining this season – away to Bayern Munich and at home to Wolfsburg – after which there is likely to be an official announcement on Jovic’s future.
