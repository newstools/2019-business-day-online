British Prime Minister and leader of the country’s Conservative Party, Theresa May announced on Friday morning that she would resign from office on June 7, paving the way for a leadership context that would produce a leader to possibly drive through the tough Brexit deal. In a very emotional, but dignified speech which she delivered in front of her number 10 Downing Street office, May expressed her regrets for not being able to deliver Brexit. May who became the UK’s second female prime minister in July 2016 has been under immense pressure from lawmakers opposed to her Brexit plans. She said it is has been a great honour to serve as the second female Prime minister of the country but “certainly not the last.” She said she had been struggling to get parliamentary support for the legislation needed to implement the deal she had agreed with the EU on how the UK would leave the bloc. She said she tried her best “three times” to convince the parliament to accept her Brexit deal but failed. Efforts to find a compromise with the opposition Labour Party also failed. Compromise is not a dirty word, she said obviously sounding a warning to her successor of the need to get all parties along for a consensus. “Life depends on compromise,” she stressed. May becomes the second British Minister to be consumed by the UK plans to leave the European Union, following her immediate successor, David Cameron, who resigned after his Labour Party could not convince the citizens to stay within the European Union. In her speech, she also used the opportunity to reel out her achievements over the last three years including improvements in the economy, job security, efforts on climate change and carrying all the citizens along. She, however, sounded hopeful that her Conservative party will deliver Brexit which the British citizens voted for.
