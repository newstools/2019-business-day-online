The race for the 2018/19 Premier League season is over as Pep Guardiolaâ€™s Manchester City side on the final day of season claim their second straight Premier League titles. Man City enjoyed an incredible run of 14-straight victories to end the season with 98 points, one point clear of Liverpool, who they trailed by seven points in early January. Glenn Murray opened the scoring for Brighton & Hove Albion to give Man City a scare, but Sergio Aguero equalised and then Aymeric Laporte put Man City ahead before the break. Riyad Mahrez scored a stunner to make it 3-1 in the second half, as Man City eased to the title with Ilkay Gundogan adding 4-1 with a superb free-kick. City finish the season on 98 points, one ahead of Liverpool with 97 points to record the second-highest points tally in Premier League history, two points less than the record they set last season. With the League Cup and Premier League title already secured, Man City will now be the first English team to ever complete a domestic treble if they beat Watford in the FA Cup final next Saturday.
