Arik Air, one of Nigeria’s leading Airlines, has adjusted its scheduled operations to cope with the exigencies of its aircraft that are on mandatory maintenance. In a statement issued Monday by Adebanji Ola, the airline’s communication manager, it said its fleet had witnessed a reduction in number in the last two weeks because some aircraft had been flown overseas to Approved Maintenance Organisation (AMO) in Europe. “The management stated that in order to maintain schedule integrity and ensure flights depart on time, it had to cut down on the number of flights operated daily,” Ola stated. Arik further stated that as a safety-conscious airline, it takes aircraft maintenance very seriously. It however assured its customers that the aircraft would start returning from maintenance in the next few days while scheduled operations would be back to normal in a couple of weeks. Roy Ilegbodu, the Chief Executive Officer of Arik Air, elaborated: “We regret any inconveniences that our customers may suffer due to this schedule adjustment. We are almost done with the checks and our customers will start seeing the effect with improved services.” The airline appealed to its customers to bear with it at this period while assuring that their safety and comfort would not be compromised.
