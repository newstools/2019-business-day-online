Thus far the uptake of new and underused vaccines is increasing, yet there are still nearly 20 million unvaccinated and under-vaccinated children in the world today. Since 2010, 113 countries have introduced new vaccines, and more than 20 million additional children have been vaccinated. In 2017 alone, the number of children immunised – 116.2 million – was the highest ever reported [iv].  Despite these gains, all the targets for disease elimination—including measles, rubella and maternal and neonatal tetanus—are behind schedule, and over the last two years the world has seen multiple outbreaks of measles, diphtheria and various other vaccine-preventable diseases. Most of the children who miss out are those living in the poorest, marginalised and conflict-affected communities.  Some of the barriers preventing vaccinations include, the lack of adequate healthcare system infrastructure, issues regarding vaccine cold chain logistics, the lack of political and financial commitment as well as a shortage of healthcare workers in these communities to name but a few. By investing in partnership activities and in-market programs, these barriers may be overcome.  Expanding access to immunisation is vital for achieving the sustainable development goals, poverty reduction and universal health coverage. Routine immunisation provides a point of contact for health care at the beginning of life and offers every child the chance at a healthy life from the earliest beginnings and into a graceful old age.
