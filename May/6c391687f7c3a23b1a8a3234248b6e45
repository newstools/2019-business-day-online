The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, Friday, held that the suspension of the Chief Justice of Nigeria, Justice Walter Onnoghen, was illegal and unlawful. The appellate court said the suspension was carried out before he was formally arraigned at the Code of Conduct Tribunal but added that the appeal had been overtaken by event since trial has been concluded and the ex-parte order spent already. The court struck out three other appeals for being incompetent, holding that they are either speculative or presumptive. Judgment on other appeals still on-going  Details laterâ€¦.
