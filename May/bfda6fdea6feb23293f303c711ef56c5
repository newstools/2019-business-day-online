According to reports in Spain, Real Madrid are close to announce the signing of Chelsea star Eden Hazard. Madrid will this Thursday make Chelsea an offer that they believe will be definitive, and convince Chelsea to sell the Belgian player. Hazard delivered  Europa League with Chelsea on Wednesday night in Baku scoring twice in a 4-1 rout of Arsenal and has sent a goodbye message to Chelsea fans. Hazard himself made the situation clear at the end of the game when he was interviewed by BT Sport: “I think it’s goodbye but in football you never know. My dream was to play in the Premier League and I did this for seven years in one of the biggest clubs in the world and maybe it’s time for a new challenge.” “I’ve taken my decision already. Now it depends on the club. I’m just waiting like the fans wait, so you will know in a couple of days,” he added. Anthony Nlebem
