Symbol Mining, which mines zinc and lead, has successfully installed and commissioned the second wash plant at its Macy Mine site in the Benue trough. The company confirmed this development in an email statement signed by its managing director, Tim Wither, and sent to BusinessDay. The plant, which took ten months to complete, is now set to complement the first plant previously installed. The second wash plant, which is much bigger than the first, was designed with the ability to increase zinc concentrate production. According to Wither, both wash plants can now produce approximately 100 tonnes of zinc per day. On this basis, the combined processing plants have the capacity to achieve approximately 3,000 tonnes of zinc concentrate per month. “Achieving the processing capability of 3,000 tonnes of concentrate per month is the final state in the Macy operations ability to become cashflow positive,” Wither said. In another development, the company has equally commenced the exploration of a 1,000-metre exploration drill programme. According to Wither, the reason for the exploration is to gain more knowledge of what was not previously known, and to explore new frontiers.  JOSEPH MAURICE OGU
