Within the last few years, agriculture in Nigeria has experienced a massive growth. More people are beginning to cultivate and grow their own food as well as starting livestock or crop farms for profit. This implies that more farmers are paying more attention to the level of crop productivity on their farms. Notwithstanding the impressive results, some farmers are still experiencing a downfall in crop yield year after year because of the poor farming techniques they apply unknowingly while cultivating crops. The method of crop cultivation from land preparation to the end of the farm cycle determines the quality and quantity of farm produce that would be harvested. Crop productivity is an essential part of every farmer’s journey, so if you are disappointed at harvest because of a decrease in your farm produce, one of these highlighted points you are about to read might be the reason. The knowledge of best farming practices to adopt cannot be overemphasized. When you use the best methods in cultivating your food crops, you reap a bountiful harvest and when you do not, you get little or nothing at all. It is the responsibility of every farmer to care for their farm in and out of planting season.  HANNAH EDIA Hannah is the Lead SEO/Content Development at Farmcrowdy.
