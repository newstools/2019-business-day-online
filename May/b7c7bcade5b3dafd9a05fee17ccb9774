Outgone governor of Lagos State, Akinwunmi Ambode was absent at TBS, venue of the swearing in of Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, his successor. There have been rumours before now that Ambode would not attend the historic event, having already handed over to Sanwoolu, in a closed door arrangement, on Tuesday. It was gathered that Ambode chose not to show up at the swearing-in, in order not take the shine off Sanwoolu, as the new governor and his wife, deserve to enjoy their historic day of glory.
