Meanwhile, the share price of MTN Nigeria recorded its first decline nine days after it was admitted to the main board of the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE). It shed 6.04 percent to close at N140 per share on Friday May 24, 2019. MTN Nigeria ended the week with a market capitalisation of N2.85 trillion representing 21 percent of the overall equity market while Dangote Cement which ended the week at N200 per share and controlled 25 percent of the equity market capitalisation. It ended the week with N3.41 trillion market capitalisation. In spite of the decline, analysts are of the views that the sentiment towards MTN Nigeria is still very strong and positive. “Having rallied strongly to N150 level, I think today’s breather in MTN’s share price is expected, particularly as the current price aligns with peer valuation. Notably, at N145, the stock trades around 6.4x EBITDA, which is a justified premium to average peer valuation of 5.6x, considering the growth and strong fundamentals of the business in Nigeria. As you rightly know that the listing price of N90 was a benchmark valuation anchored on the OTC price of linked notes, hence, the market is still searching for the fair value for the stock and hopefully, it should find a near term price equilibrium at which it can settle soon”, Abiola Rasak, head, investor’s relation at the United Bank for Africa (UBA) said. ‘Sentiment for the stock remains largely positive, and this could potentially drive further gains in the coming weeks”, Kemi Akinde, senior analyst at Meristem Securities, said.
