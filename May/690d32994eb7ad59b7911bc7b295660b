The Peoples Democratic Party Monday condemned the arrest and detention of its candidate in the 2018 Osun Governorship election, Ademola Adeleke. The party described the action by the Police as a total disregard for the extant order of the Federal High Court. “This is highly provocative, an invitation to anarchy and recipe for a very serious crisis, not only in Osun, but also in the judiciary and our polity as a nation,” the PDP National Publicity Secretary, Kola Ologbindiyan, said at a Press conference in Abuja. He added, “The arrest and detention of Senator Adeleke is a direct act of violence against our laws, the institution of the judiciary and the 1999 Constitution (as amended). “This is part of the grand plot by the All Progressives Congress to coerce Senator Adeleke to relinquish the mandate that was freely given to him by the people of Osun State, which was further established by the election petitions tribunal.” The Police had detained Senator Adeleke after who had gone to honor an invitation. The Federal High Court in Abuja had granted the senator the permission to travel to the United States of America for medical check-up. The trip had been scheduled for Tuesday, May 7. Justice Inyang Ekwo also asked him to honour a fresh Police invitation on Monday before travelling the next day. He was, however, detained after obeying the court order.
