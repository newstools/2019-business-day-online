Adams Oshiomhole, National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC says the Supreme Court has imposed on Zamfara people candidates they did not vote at the general elections. Oshiomhole made this assertion Monday while reacting to the ruling of the Supreme Court which sacked all candidates elected on his party’s platform at the general elections and declared candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party who came second at polls winners. He said, “there is no justice when on technicality you imposed on people candidates they didn’t elect”. The APC National Chairman who spoke with journalists at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja immediately after National Working Committee meeting of the party wondered why the court could describe the votes of his party’s candidates as ‘wasted’ “How can you ask me how I feel when the people of Zamfara voted for us in the manner they did and the courts said those votes were wasted? “Meanwhile at the time those votes were cast, the high court has ruled that our candidate was validly nominated. “There is something I have learnt from Lord Denning, a famous British Supreme Court Justice, that the law has to be interpreted taking into account the intention of the lawmakers and try to deliver justice in its purest form. “If the court thought that we were wrong, the justice would have demand a repeat. There is nothing democratic when you impose a stranger to govern the people. “But we understand that after the Supreme Court you can only go to the court of God. To that extent we must obey the Supreme Court but what we got in Zamfara is a judgment that didn’t translate to justice,” he said.  James Kwen, Abuja
