Nigeria’s big banks received a combined N16.9 trillion from customers through deposits across various account types in the quarter one of 2019, which is 12.5 percent above N15.1 trillion collected in the previous comparable period. Analysis of total deposits received from customers based on account type for the tier-one lenders revealed that 44 percent, equivalent to N7.54 trillion, were paid into current account. According to Yinka Ademuwagu, research analyst at Lagos-based investment advisory firm, United Capital Plc, this points to the fact that banks are leveraging financial technology (Fintech) to grow their customer deposits. “Most banks are seen to be exploiting Fintech such as Chatbot, USSD and Internet Banking to penetrate into the economy and bank the unbanked”, Ademuwagu claimed, adding that overall, it connotes betterment in economic activities. Customers deposited N4.05 trillion in term account; N3.82 trillion in savings account, N1.53 trillion in domiciliary account and N11.08 billion in electronic purse account, on the aggregate, in Access Bank, Zenith Bank, United Bank for Africa, Guaranty Trust Bank and First Bank. The five account types recorded an uptick year-on-year in the review period. Customers’ deposits to term account were N392.79 billion higher than N3.66 trillion reported in the first quarter of 2018.

The five banks registered positive growth in customer deposits, with Access Bank leading the pack with 53.37 percent increase to N3.91 trillion, partly attributable to the fact that the lender merged with the defunct Diamond Bank to leverage the former’s expansive retail customer base.
