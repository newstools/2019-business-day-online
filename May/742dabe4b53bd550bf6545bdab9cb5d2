Ibrahim Abubakar, a governorship aspirants on the platform of the People’s Democratic Party ( PDP ) in Kogi State has said that the state accounts for the highest volume of cashew nut export in the country. Abubakar, who disclosed this recently in Lokoja during a media parley organised by the Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ), said that with proper coordination the State could transform its economy through the commodity. He equally disclosed that sorting, washing and processing of the crop which are done in other countries could be done in Kogi State to create jobs and improve revenue coming into the state. “Sorting of cashew seeds is being done in South Africa, washing in Ghana and processing in India. All this can be done here in Kogi state with proper coordination to generate employment and improve revenue,” he said. He also emphasised that Kogi is blessed with much arable land and a high number of educated dynamic men, women and youths that could turn the fortune of the state through agriculture.
