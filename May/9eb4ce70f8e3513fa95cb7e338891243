The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Tuesday, May 28, 2019, injected the sum of $205 million into the inter-bank Foreign Exchange Market, in its continued push to sustain liquidity in the sector. Figures obtained from the CBN indicated that authorized dealers in the wholesale segment of the market were offered the sum of $100 million, while the Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) segment received the sum of $55 million. The sum of $50 million was allocated to customers requiring foreign exchange for invisibles such as tuition fees, medical payments and Basic Travel Allowance (BTA), among others. Disclosing this in Abuja, Isaac Okorafor, director, corporate communications department at the CBN, said that the Banks effort had helped to guarantee stability in all the exchange rate windows. He further noted that the dogged implementation of the countryâ€™s foreign exchange restriction to some 43 items had boosted activities in the industrial sector. He also noted that the move had equally increased the level of confidence investors and the public had in the Naira. It will be recalled that at the last intervention, the Bank injected the sum of $268.6million and CNY29.2million into the Retail Secondary Market Intervention Sales (SMIS) segment.
Meanwhile, the Naira on Tuesday, May 28, 2019, exchanged at an average of N361/$1 in the BDC segment of the market.  Hope Moses-Ashike
