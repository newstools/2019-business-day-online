Balarabe Musa, a Second Republic governor of old Kaduna State, has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to sustain his administration’s ant-graft war in his second term, saying that the country could not make any meaningful progress with the current level of corruption. Anti-graft war was a major focus of President Buhari’s first tenure; several high profile politicians were arrested and prosecuted by the Economy and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), while some were settled through plea bargaining. However, the anti-graft war has been criticised by some sections of Nigerians, who accuse him of targeting opposition politicians. But reacting to Buhari’s inauguration for a second term in office, in a telephone interview with BusinessDay Thursday, Musa noted that the country needed a radical individual who would checkmate the elites who have put the country in its present mess. According to him, “I am in support of the President’s anti-graft war; we need someone that can check the elites, political leaders that created the system. “They are responsible for the negative state of the country; they are the ones that put us here,” Musa said. On the refusal of the President to give an inaugural speech, the former governor, however, urged Nigerians to wait for the President’s speech on June12, saying that the speech on such day was more important. “Nigerians should wait for Buhari’s speech on June 12, he will speak; that is the main day that he has declared. “We should give Buhari the benefit of doubt. I believe the June 12 speech would be all-encompassing. That is a day that is significant to our democracy that is worth celebrating,” Musa added.  Iniobong Iwok
