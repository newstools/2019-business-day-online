Following the official announcement of her resignation, Theresa May’s replacement could be her former minister. Boris Johnson is seen as the most preferred candidate by some members of parliaments to clinch the position of British Prime Minister (PM). Johnny Mercer, a member of parliment was asked during a late night show whether he will be presenting himself for the PM position, he replied “I’m not goo enough to be PM yet. I’ll be with Boris Johnson campaigning together, trying to unite the party and the nation, and govern from the centre in a modern, compassionate, optimistic manner.” A new poll conducted by global public opinion and data company, YouGov found that ahead of the conservative party members decision on the PM position, Boris Johnson was most likely to beat every contenter he faces by a margin of 59 per cent to 41 per cent. Boris Johnson is also believed to command a lot of support from party grassroots, according to conservativehome.com. After May’s announcement of her resignation, Johnson had tweeted “A very dignified statement from @theresa_may. Thank you for your stoical service to our country and the Conservative Party. It is now time to follow her urgings: to come together and deliver Brexit.” Should Johnson become the new UK prime minister he faces the uphill taks of delivering Brexit as soon as possible.
