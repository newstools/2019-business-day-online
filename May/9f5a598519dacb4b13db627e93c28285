In a bid to increase the efficiency of the IT desk in every organisation, ManageEngine, an enterprise management IT management software company, in partnership with Tranter IT, has unveiled new features on its ServiceDesk Plus solution. The unveiled held in Lagos at the ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus Workshop 2019 on Thursday, 23 May, 2019. Built on ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library is the most effective standard in IT service management) version 4.0 framework and ISMS (information security management system), ServiceDesk Plus is designed to deliver top of the range automated helpdesk services to organisations. One of its objectives, according to Lare Ayoola, chief executive officer of Tranter IT in an interview, is to help organisations deliver business objectives through low-cost and optimised IT services. The IT service desk in any organisation is intended to be a primary point of engagement between users and the organisation. It is the single point of contact (SPOC) between the service provider (IT) and users for day-to-day activities. The ServiceDesk Plus provides great visibility and central control in dealing with IT issues to ensure that businesses suffer low downtime. The ServiceDesk Plus can be deployed on cloud and on-premise. “ServiceDesk Plus integrates with other IT functions,” said Karthik Ananda Rao, head of ManageEngine Sales. “You can make informed decisions based on data arrived at using ServiceDesk Plus. You don’t also have to jump between consoles; you can do all the service on the ServiceDesk console.” The latest feature of the cloud version of ServiceDesk Plus is Zia, a customised virtual support agent which can be the first point of contact for the service desk. Zia helps perform simple service desk activities and fetch information, so customers do not have to rely on a technician. “With access to a conversational virtual support agent, technicians in the field can now perform service desk activities with simple hands-free voice commands,” Tranter IT noted in a statement.
