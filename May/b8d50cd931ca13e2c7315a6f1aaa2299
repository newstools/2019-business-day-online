Atiku in a statement issued on Sunday by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe, said the enviable milestone in the life of the nationalist and elder statesman is worth celebrating more so when his life reflects the collective and continuous effort towards building a great nation. “As a great nationalist, he has patriotically served our dear country in various capacities without blemish and this is why he has remained relevant as a dependable voice of the people,” Atiku said. The former Vice President also saluted Clark’s unwavering patriotism and relentless pursuit of the unity of the country, particularly his maturity in speaking for the good of all Nigerians. “Clark possesses an indomitable and insurmountable spirit for advocacy and love for the oppressed, for which God has blessed him with long life, good health and unwavering commitment to fight injustice at all levels. “Chief Clark is a man who is not afraid to speak his mind about the things he feels strongly about,” Atiku said.
