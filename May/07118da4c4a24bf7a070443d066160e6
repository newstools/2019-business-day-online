This followed the adjournment of plenary to next week Thursday, June 6, when the House would hold valedictory session of the 8th Assembly, ahead of proclamation of the 9th Assembly on June 11. Yakubu Dogara, Speaker of the House who presided over the sitting, noted that the adjournment was to enable members observe this year’s Ramadan festival holding next Tuesday and Wednesday. At the last plenary, the Lower Legislative Chamber exhausted over 60 items, including committees’ reports, petitions and motions listed on the Order Paper. The current Assembly which tenure expires next week was proclaimed on June 9, 2015.  James Kwen, Abuja
