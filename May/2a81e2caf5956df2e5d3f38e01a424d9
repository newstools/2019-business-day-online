Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele has just arrived the National Assembly Complex, ahead of his screening by the Senate. The apex bank boss who arrived the National Assembly Complex on Wednesday, was immediately ushered into the office of the Senior Special Adviser to the President on National Assembly Matters (Senate) at exactly 11:35am. He is expected to be screened by the Senate Committee on Banking, Insurance and other Financial Institutions any moment from now. The screening will take place at Committee Room 204, New Senate Building. In a letter read on the floor of the Senate last Thursday, President Muhammadu Buhari had asked the Senate to confirm the reappointment of Godwin Emefiele as Governor of the apex bank for a second and final term of five years. On Tuesday, Senate President Bukola Saraki referred the matter to the Rafiu Ibrahim-led panel to report back within one week.
