And Article 5 of the United Nations Protocol enjoins State parties to criminalize practices and conducts that subject human beings to all forms of exploitation which includes, in the minimum, sexual and labour exploitation.” Speaking Further, the Minister said that “it is gratifying to note that the government has made frantic efforts at combating the scourge through the establishment of the National Agency for Prohibition of Trafficking in persons (NAPTIP) by an act of Parliament which came into being on 8th of August,2003, an Agency which is the creation of Trafficking in persons (Prohibition) Enforcement and Administration Act (TIPPEA) 2015 as re-enacted to respond to trafficking in persons in the country and its attendant human abuses in its entire ramification, which is also a fulfilment of her International obligation under the trafficking in persons protocol supplementing the United Nations Transnational Organised Crime.” He added that the establishment of the National Steering Committee on Child Labour, (NSCCL), Constitution and Inauguration of State Steering Committees on Child Labour (SSCCL), with designated child labour desk officers to drive the objectives of these policy documents in all the 36 State labour offices and the FCT, National Reporting Template on the NAP has been developed with the relevant stakeholders across the six (6) geopolitical Zones of Nigeria trained on its applications for performance evaluation and measurement and collaboration with the United States Department of Labour (USDOL) through the US Embassy Labour Attache on the eradication of Child Labour, are all efforts by the Nigeria Government to accelerate the fight against Child labour. The Minister however appealed for continued support and assistance of the US government to establish a Child Labour Trust Fund, Child Labour Rehabilitation Centres in the six Geopolitical Zones in the Country and the FCT, among others, the statement said.
