The completed but yet-to-be commissioned Dangote Fertilizer Company, Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd in India and Nakhodka Fertilizer Plant in Russia, are the top-three companies expected to contribute to the planned capacity additions worldwide for Ammonia production over the next nine years period. Global ammonia capacity is expected to experience considerable growth over the next nine years from around 230 metric ton per annum (mtpa) in 2018 to more than 280 mtpa by 2027. More than 95 planned and announced ammonia plants are expected to come online, primarily in Asia and the Middle East over the next nine years. The fertiliser plant which is located at Lekki Free Trade Zone is set for inauguration anytime soon this year. The official commissioning date is yet to be fixed according to sources close to Dangote  group. Aliko Dangote, Africa’s richest man and chairman of the Dangote Group, said the ongoing investment in refining, petrochemicals, fertiliser and gas was driven by the desire to bring innovation and efficiency into all aspects of Nigeria’s oil and gas sector. He said the 650,000-barrels per day capacity refinery being built would become the world largest single train refinery on completion, describing it as a boost to Nigeria’s economy. According to him, the group is also constructing the largest fertiliser plant in West Africa with a capacity to produce 3.0 million tonnes of urea per year. “Nigeria will be able to save $0.5bn from import substitution and provide $0.4bn from exports of products from the fertiliser plant. Thus, the supply of fertiliser from the plant, which is set for inauguration before the second quarter of 2019, will be enough for the Nigerian market and neighbouring countries,” he said. The Dangote Fertilizer complex consists of Ammonia and Urea plants with associated facilities and infrastructure, to produce 3 MMTPA Urea. The complex comprises: 2 x 2,200 MTPD Ammonia Plants based on Halder Topsoe technology, 2 x 4,000 MTPD Melt Urea Plants based on Snamprogetti technology, 2 x 4,000 MTPD Urea Granulation Plants based on Uhde Technology.
