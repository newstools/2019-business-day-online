Guy Futi, managing director of Jumia’s food marketplace, has announced an on-demand pizza delivery partnership between Jumia Foods and Pizza Hut. According to Jumia, the partnership is expected to boost operational performance and last-mile delivery in Nigeria. “As the premier food delivery business in Nigeria, we are opening up our platform to enable our customers to order pizza from Pizza Hut while ensuring that it is delivered at record time,” Futi said in a statement made available to BusinessDay. “Currently, our average delivery time is less than 45 minutes which is the quickest in Nigeria. We are reinforcing our operations to further cut our average delivery time to guarantee that both food and pizza are delivered at best times to our customers while not compromising quality,” he added. On his part, Tony Ozanne, chief executive officer of Marathon Restaurant Africa, which manages and operates Pizza Hut in Nigeria, explained that as a new entrant into the Nigerian market, an extensive research was conducted to identify key players in the market and Jumia’s food marketplace was chosen, thus leading to the partnership. “Jumia’s Food marketplace has the platform and the customers. We felt that since we are new in Nigeria, we can ride on their back to get the traction we want. As from today, you can either walk into our three locations in Ikoyi, Ikeja City Mall and Lekki to buy Pizza or take the convenient step by ordering on Jumia’s Food marketplace,” Ozanne said. On the business expansion plans in Nigeria, he said “in the next five years, we are looking at expanding our footprint to Abuja, Port Harcourt, Ibadan and of course open more outlets in Lagos. And as we touch these cities and towns in Nigeria, so will our partnership with Jumia’s food marketplace grow.”  Josephine Okojie
