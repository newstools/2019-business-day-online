The Senate is currently in a closed door session with the Acting Inspector General of Police, Mohammed Adamu over the rising insecurity in many parts of the country. The police chief who entered the National Assembly Complex around 11am was welcomed into the Senate chambers at exactly 11:20am after the Senate Leader, Ahmad Lawan, moved a motion that the Senate dissolve into Committee of the Whole to receive him. The Acting IGâ€™s invitation was sequel to a motion moved by Shehu Sani (PRP, Kaduna) and co-sponsored by 108 other senators on April 30, 2019. Specifically, the police boss is expected to speak on efforts of his men to quell escalating cases of banditry, armed robbery, terrorists attacks and kidnappings in Kaduna, Katsina, Zamfara, Niger, Yobe, Borno, Adamawa, Benue, Taraba, Plateau, Nasarawa, Kogi, Enugu, Imo, Cross River, Edo, Delta, Abia, Kwara, Taraba, Osun, Ondo, Sokoto and other parts of the country. BusinessDay reports that the orgy of kidnapping has made major national roads especially in the North West impassable. The Abuja/Kaduna road is one major road that has been affected, as travellers have abandoned the ever busy highway following incessant kidnappings in preference for rail transport.
