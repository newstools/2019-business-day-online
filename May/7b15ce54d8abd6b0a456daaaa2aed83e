Newly sworn-in Ogun state governor, Dapo Abiodun, has vowed to review all ongoing capital projects being executed across the state by the immediate past government of Ibikunle Amosun, saying the new government would review the project costs, amount disbursed and date of completion. Governor Dapo Abiodun, who took Oaths of Allegiance and Office at MKO Abiola International Stadium on Wednesday as the fifth democratically elected governor of the state, added that he would not hesitate to review suspected misuse of commonwealth of the state, saying any individual and organization found culpable would be held accountable and dealt with accordingly. While speaking in company of Deputy, Noimot Salako-Oyedele, who was also sworn in by Justice Mosunmola Dipeolu, Chief Judge of the state, reiterated that he would not “hesitate to review any suspected misuse of the commonwealth and hold accountable any individual or organisation found culpable.” Governor Abiodun, who explained that the exercise was neither a witch hunt nor targeted at any administration or individual, said, “In the next few days, we will set up an Assets and Projects Assessment Committee that will, among others, assess all ongoing projects in the State with a view to determining the current status, percentage of completion, project costs, amount disbursed, and expected dates of completion. “The committee will also advise on the potential benefits to the state and our people and the priority that should be attached to each project. “The Committee will also identify all dormant assets of the state, their
locations and how they could be deployed to support the vision of
economic development and individual prosperity of our people. “The immediate past Administration provided to us yesterday (on Tuesday) a Handover Notes. We will study this and it will form part of the input document to the work of the committee.”  RAZAQ AYINLA, Abeokuta
