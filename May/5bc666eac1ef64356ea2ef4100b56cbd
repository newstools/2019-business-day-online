A few months after winning the first prize in a pitch for African start-ups in Washington DC, United States, EZ-Farming has emerged among the top 100 finalists in the FedEx small business competition. The agricultural start-up, with offices in Nigeria and the United States of America (USA), is one of the few to make the mark in a competition in which over 13,000 start-ups across the world took part in and over 1.3 million votes cast on social media to select the finalists. EZ-Farming recorded this feat less than three months after clinching the first prize of $5000 and the peoples’ choice award at the 2019 Georgetown African Business Conference New Venture Competition. Adewale Oparinde, founder, EZ-Farming in a statement said the team and investors are elated with the feat and that it would push them to continue to deliver returns for the benefit of its key stakeholders. “We are indeed glad we made it to the top 100 from over 13,000 start-ups across the globe that competed in the competition and it was a delight that we recorded such an impressive feat in few months of operation,” Oparinde said. He noted that EZ- Farming will continue to improve its platform to deliver on its value proposition, assuring investors that the growing list of recognition is an acknowledgement of the firm’s commitment to excellence and creativity. “We appreciate our fans for supporting us to reach this great milestone and for supporting our vision to achieve double impact of empowering both youth and farmers through intergenerational exchange of expertise to create more commercial farms from small holdings,” he further said. EZ-Farming is a fast-growing agritech start-up with a commitment to pulling investment from Africa and its diaspora to drive commercial farming in the continent and empower youths through the intergenerational transfer of agribusiness best practices. In full operation in less than a year, the start-up has raised almost $1million in investment and plans, and has expanded from its Nigeria base to the United States and other African countries, including Sierra Leone.
