The defence team of Isiaka Adeleke has on Tuesday morning asked the magistrate court to discontinue the case against their client since there are subsisting court rulings barring the police from arresting and detaining Adeleke over the matter. The Nigerian Police Force had arraigned Isiaka Adeleke, the gubernatorial candidate of the People’s Democratic Party in Osun State, at a magistrate court after he was arrested on Monday. The force through its spokeman, Frank Mba, said Adeleke will be tried in connection with a criminal investigation. “Senator Adeleke is currently in police custody. He was taken into custody in the evening of 6th, May, 2019, in connection with ongoing criminal investigations touching on his person. “Meanwhile, in the best tradition of natural justice and fair hearing, he has already been served with the relevant charge sheet containing his alleged offences in the presence of his attorneys,” Mba said.
