There is outrage among social media users around the world following a report that a vulnerability in the software allowed attackers to hack into peopleâ€™s phones using commercial Israeli spyware. The chat app, owned by Facebook Inc., said it had discovered a vulnerability in early May that could enable attackers to insert and execute code on mobile devices. WhatsApp said it made changes to its infrastructure late last week to block the attacks from taking place and has Tuesday asked users to take immediate steps to update their application with the latest version. Here is the simple step to be taken to upgrade your WhatsApp. If you are an android user, go to Google play store, tap My Apps & Games and then tap on Update WhatsApp. However, if you are an iOS user, go to the App store, you will find updates at the bottom of your screen and then tap on Update WhatsApp. It is believed that human rights crusaders and journalists have been identified as the main target of hackers.
