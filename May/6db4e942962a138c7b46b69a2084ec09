Chelsea hammered Arsenal 4-1 to end the  season with an Europa League trophy. Two goals from Eden Hazard after strikes from Olivier Giroud and Pedro put Chelsea in command in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the Blues winning the Europa League final after a goal-filled second half. Alex Iwobi managed to grab a consolation, but Chelsea had evidently recovered from whatever spat saw Maurizio Sarri storm out of training on Tuesday night. For Arsenal, it is another year of promising , but never really delivering. For Chelsea, this is a game that could mark Hazard’s exit with triumph, and may even save Sarri’s job. Arsenal, had been hoping to win in order to qualify for next season’s Champions League after a fifth-place finish in England,  but will instead find itself back in the Europa League next season. Chelsea, meanwhile, claims its second Europa League crown in seven seasons, despite having the safety net of already qualifying for the UCL with a third-place run in the Premier League. Hazard, in what could well have been his last match with Chelsea as reports of a move to Real Madrid swirl, was sensational on the night, and if he does exit the club, he’ll do so with a European title.
