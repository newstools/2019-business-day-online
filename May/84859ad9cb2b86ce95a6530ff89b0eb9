Analysts and stakeholders in the market have attributed the bearish run in the nation’s capital market to flat results reported by most companies at the end of the quarter. “ Q1 earnings have been a mix bag. Whilst companies like UBA, Access and CNN showed strong growth in top and bottom lines, others reported flat and or negative performance. Hence, it may be right to partly attribute the broadly bearish market to the relatively weak Q1 earnings. “Albeit, investors are on the sideline ahead of the announcement of new cabinet and leadership of monetary authority, particularly as such appointments may have notable influence on monetary and fiscal policies, going forward. For instance, the orientation and policy drive of the CBN Governor can potentially influence monetary policy around exchange rate management, which remains the domino variable for the market”, said Abiola Razaq, head investor’s relations, the United Bank for Africa. Furthermore, companies listed in the tourism and hospitality sub sector recorded decline in profit after tax. Ikeja Hotels’ PAT fell by 42 percent; Capital Hotel recoded 46 percent decline in the same metric; Transcorp Hotels’ PAT fell by 50 percent while that of the Tourist Company of Nigeria ended in a loss for the quarter. ‘The unimpressive earnings across stocks in most sectors have been a major drag on the market sentiment in this period. Despite analysts’ predictions and expectation for a market rebound after Q1 2019, the recent companies’ performance, especially when you look at the heavyweights in the market, have made us changed our outlook”, said Chinonye Nnewuihe, senior analyst with Meristem Securities.
