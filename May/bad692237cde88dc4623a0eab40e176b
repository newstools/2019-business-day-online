Lagos State governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, on Thursday, signed an executive order to restore sanity to chaotic Lagos traffic situation and improve environmental sanitation. The executive order,  according to Sanwo-Olu, will start the process of restoring stability and a culture of accountability in which all the citizens become active stakeholders in bringing about the necessary changes. Tagged ‘Enforcement of law and order in respect of Traffic and sanitation matters’ henceforth, there shall be zero tolerance for environmental abuse, including illegal and indiscriminate dumping of refuse, construction on drainage points and setbacks. In line with this, all LASTMA officials shall effectively carry out their functions by ensuring strict enforcement and compliance with all extant traffic rules and regulations while LASTMA officials will immediately begin work on a shift basis, in which road and traffic management operations will be on till 11 pm on a daily basis. Also, the Lagos State Public Works Corporation will immediately commence the identification and repairs of all potholes and bad roads within the state. Meanwhile, the governor has also met with civil servants in the state, and charged them to be up and doing, promising to see to their welfare.  Joshua Bassey
