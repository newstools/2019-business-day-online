Prince Harry has announced the arrival of his baby boy on Monday. The Duke of Sussex spoke to the press just after the royal baby’s birth: “I haven’t been in many births, this is definitely my first birth! But it was amazing, absolutely incredible, and as I said, I’m so incredibly proud of my wife. As every father and parent would say, your baby is absolutely amazing. But this little thing is absolutely to die for, so I’m just over the moon,” he said. Meghan and Harry moved away from tradition by opting to keep the birth of their first child private before sharing the news with the public.
