The Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, will on Monday take final decision on the Supreme Court judgement that annulled all votes scored by the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, at the last general elections in Zamfara State. The apex court in the judgement on Friday declared that the candidates of political parties with the second highest valid votes and the requisite spread should be returned as having been elected. Reacting to the judgement, Festus Okoye, INEC National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, said the Commission held an emergency meeting shortly after the judgement and would meet again Saturday. “Following the Supreme Court’s judgment delivered today 24th May 2019 on the Governorship, National and State Assembly elections held in Zamfara State, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) held an emergency meeting to consider the court’s decision. “The Supreme Court ruled that the All Progressives Congress (APC) did not hold valid party primaries as required by law. It held that all the votes scored by the APC in the said elections are wasted votes and declared that the candidates of political parties with the second highest valid votes and the requisite spread should be declared as having been elected. “The Commission will meet again tomorrow Saturday 25th May 2019 to further deliberate on the issues arising from the said judgment, while the final decision on the matter will be communicated to the public on Monday 27th May 2019”, he stated.
